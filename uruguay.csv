Data acquisition rates reaching more than thousands of images per second enable the real-time visualization of shear mechanical waves propagating in biological tissues, which convey information about local viscoelastic properties of tissues. The first proposed approach for reaching such ultrafast frame rates consists of transmitting plane waves into the medium. However, because the beamforming process is then restricted to the receive mode, the echographic images obtained in the ultrafast mode suffer from a low quality in terms of resolution and contrast and affect the robustness of the transient elastography mode. It is here proposed to improve the beamforming process by using a coherent recombination of compounded plane-wave transmissions to recover high-quality echographic images without degrading the high frame rate capabilities. A theoretical model is derived for the comparison between the proposed method and the conventional B-mode imaging in terms of contrast, signal-to-noise ratio, and resolution. Our model predicts that a significantly smaller number of insonifications, 10 times lower, is sufficient to reach an image quality comparable to conventional B-mode. Theoretical predictions are confirmed by in vitro experiments performed in tissue-mimicking phantoms. Such results raise the appeal of coherent compounds for use with standard imaging modes such as B-mode or color flow. Moreover, in the context of transient elastography, ultrafast frame rates can be preserved while increasing the image quality compared with flat insonifications. Improvements on the transient elastography mode are presented and discussed. © 2006 IEEE."

Catholique de Louvain, B-1348 Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium",A new design methodology based on a unified treatment of all the regions of operation of the MOS transistor is proposed. It is intended for the design of CMOS analog circuits and especially suited for low power circuits where the moderate inversion region often is used because it provides a good compromise between speed and power consumption. The synthesis procedure is based on the relation between the ratio of the transconductance over dc drain current gm/ID and the normalized current ID/(W/L). The gm/ID indeed is a universal characteristic of all the transistors belonging to a same process. It may be derived from experimental measurements and fitted with simple analytical models. The method was applied successfully to the design of a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) micropower operational transconductance amplifier (OTA).

Specific emphasis is laid on the design of an ATM-based routing scheme for the ISL part of the system. The approach is to prepare a virtual topology by means of virtual path connections (VPC's) connecting all pairs of end nodes in the ISL subnetwork for a complete period in advance, similar to implementing a set of (time dependent) routing tables. The search for available end-to-end routes within the ISL network is based on a modified Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm (M-DSPA) capable of coping with the time-variant topology. With respect to the deterministic time variance of the considered ISL topologies, an analysis of optimization aspects for the selection of a path at call setup time is presented. The performance of the path search in combination with a specific optimization procedure is - by means of extensive simulations - evaluated for example LEO and MEO ISL topologies, respectively."

Two different replacement percentages of cement by RHA, 10% and 20%, and three different water/cementicious material ratios (0.50, 0.40 and 0.32), were used. The results are compared with those of the concrete without RHA, with splitting tensile strength and air permeability. It is concluded that residual RHA provides a positive effect on the compressive strength at early ages, but the long term behavior of the concretes with RHA produced by controlled incineration was more significant. Results of splitting tensile and air permeability reveal the significance of the filler and pozzolanic effect for the concretes with residual RHA and RHA produced by controlled incineration. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

U-Pb (SHRIMP) detrital zircon ages from representative metasedimentary units of the Ribeira and Dom Feliciano belts (South America) and Gariep and Damara belts (Africa) provide constraints on the possible sediment source areas across probable suture zones. Ribeira detrital zircons are Palaeoproterozoic and Archaean. For the Dom Feliciano Belt, a contribution of Meso- and Neoproterozoic zircons is present, which definitely indicate Neoproterozoic sedimentation. It is proposed that the inflow of material to the Ribeira basin was essentially derived from the Parana-panema and Rio de la Plata cratons, whereas for the Damara and Gariep-Rocha belts source areas were from the Namaqua Belt. The Dom Feliciano Belt received sediments from the South American side and to a lesser degree from African sources.

We propose the use of nodal pricing that is often used in the pricing of short-term operations in transmission. As an economically efficient mechanism, nodal pricing would properly reward DG for reducing line losses through increased revenues at nodal prices and signal prospective DG where it ought to connect with the distribution network. Applying nodal pricing to a model distribution network, we show significant price differences between buses reflecting high marginal losses. Moreover, we show the contribution of a DG resource located at the end of the network to significant reductions in losses and line loading. We also show the DG resource has significantly greater revenue under nodal pricing, reflecting its contribution to reduced line losses and loading. © 2006 IEEE."

Another absorption edge close to 500nm corresponding to CdS with bandgap energy values between 2.43 and 2.59eV is observed. The dispersion in this value may originate in quantum confinement inside the nanocrystalline material. The appearance of both edges corresponds with the separation of ZnO and CdS phases and reveals the absorption increase due to CdS sensitizer. The photovoltaic performance of the resulting ZnO/CdS core/shell nanorod arrays has been investigated as solar cell photoanodes in a photoelectrochemical cell under white illumination. In comparison with bare ZnO nanorod arrays, a 13-fold enhancement in photoactivity was observed using the ZnO/CdS coaxial heterostructures. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd."

For linear time-invariant uncertainty, a convex method based on linear matrix inequalities (LMI's) across the frequency variable is given. For nonlinear or time-varying perturbations and H∞ performance, the design problem is reduced exactly to a state-space LMI, and extensions to H2 performance are discussed. An example illustrates the application of these techniques to two-degree-of-freedom control design."

Different percentages of RHA replacement levels, two RHAs (amorphous and partially crystalline optimized by dry-milling) and several water-cementitious materials ratio are studied. The following durability aspects were tested: air permeability, chloride ion penetration, alkali-silica expansion, sulfate and acid resistance. The results were compared with those of cementitious materials without RHA. It is concluded from the tested properties that the incorporation of both RHAs in concretes show different behaviors for air permeability and chloride ion penetration depending on the water/cementitious materials ratio used; in mortars, it reduces the mass loss of specimens exposed to hydrochloric acid solution and decreases the expansion due to sulfate attack and the alkali-silica reaction. The results of durability aspects due to physical or pozzolanic effects after the addition of both RHAs, and its chemical composition, in general indicate an enhanced performance, proving the feasibility of its rational utilization as a supplementary cementing material. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Antibodies against Cronobacter were covalently attached onto polymer brushes of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly(HEMA)) grafted from the SPR chip surface. The lowest detection limit, 10 4cellsmL -1, was achieved in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) with sensors prepared by covalent immobilization of the same antibodies onto a self assembled monolayer (SAM) of hexa(ethylene glycol) undecanethiol (EG 6). However, when the EG 6 based sensors were challenged with milk samples the non-specific response due to the deposition of non-targeted compounds from the milk samples was much higher than the specific response to Cronobacter hampering the detection in milk. Similar interfering fouling was observed on antifouling polymer brushes of hydroxy-capped oligoethylene glycol methacrylate and even a 10 times higher fouling was observed on the widely used SAM of mixed hydroxy- and carboxy-terminated alkanethiols. Only poly(HEMA) brushes totally suppressed the fouling from milk samples. The robust well-controlled surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization of HEMA allowed the preparation of highly dense brushes with a minimal thickness so that the capture of antigens by the antibodies immobilized on the brush layer could take place close to the gold SPR surface to provide a stronger optical response while the fouling was still suppressed. A minimum thickness of 19. nm of poly(HEMA) brush layer was necessary to suppress completely non-specific sensor response to fouling from milk. © 2011 Elsevier B.V."

HNO3 oxidation of these carbons greatly enhances their ability to retain Cr(III) mainly because of a significant increase of the concentration of carbon-oxygen surface groups. To characterize these surface groups, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) were used. The influence of these carbon-oxygen surface groups on chromium adsorption is examined. Upon addition of acidic groups, some other functions of nonacidic character evolving as CO upon TPD seem to contribute to Cr(III) uptake. Modifications of the porous structure upon oxidation and chromium adsorption are investigated. Adsorption into the micropores appears to take place to a significant extent although oxidation of the active carbons leads to a narrowing of the average micropore widths."

In phase I, lumen geometry, flow rates, and fluid properties were specified, leaving each research group to choose their solver, discretization, and solution strategies. Variability was assessed by having each group interpolate their results onto a standardized mesh and centerline. For phase II, a physical model of the geometry was constructed, from which pressure and flow rates were measured. Groups repeated their simulations using a geometry reconstructed from a micro-computed tomography (CT) scan of the physical model with the measured flow rates and fluid properties. Phase I results from 25 groups demonstrated remarkable consistency in the pressure patterns, with the majority predicting peak systolic pressure drops within 8% of each other. Aneurysm sac flow patterns were more variable with only a few groups reporting peak systolic flow instabilities owing to their use of high temporal resolutions. Variability for phase II was comparable, and the median predicted pressure drops were within a few millimeters of mercury of the measured values but only after accounting for submillimeter errors in the reconstruction of the life-sized flow model from micro-CT. In summary, pressure can be predicted with consistency by CFD across a wide range of solvers and solution strategies, but this may not hold true for specific flow patterns or derived quantities. Future challenges are needed and should focus on hemodynamic quantities thought to be of clinical interest. © 2013 American Society of Mechanical Engineers."

Cryopreservation is widely used to preserve blood vessels for vascular reconstruction but it is controversially suspected to affect the dynamic behaviour of these allografts. The aim of this work was to assess the cryopreservation's effects on human arteries mechanical properties. Common carotid artery (CCA) segments harvested from donors were divided into two groups: Fresh (n = 18), tested for 24-48 h after harvesting, and Cryopreserved (n = 18) for an average time of 30 days in gas-nitrogen phase, and finally defrosted. Each segment was tested in a circulation mock, and its pressure and diameter were registered at similar pump frequency, pulse and mean pressure levels, including those of normotensive and hipertensive conditions. A compliance transfer function (diameter/pressure) derived from a mathematical adaptive modelling was designed for the on line assessment of the arterial wall dynamics and its frequency response. Assessment of arterial wall dynamics was made by measuring its viscous (η), inertial (M) and elastic (E) properties, and creep and stress relaxation time constant (τC and τSR, respectively). The frequency response characterization allowed to evaluate the arterial wall filter or buffer function. Results showed that non-significant differences exist between wall dynamics and buffer function of fresh and cryopreserved segments of human CCA. In conclusion, our cryopreservation method maintains arterial wall functional properties, close to their fresh values. © Springer 2006."

The method is derived from the philosophy behind the widely used MW-mile methodology for transmission networks that bases fixed cost allocations on the ""extent of use"" that is derived from load flows. We calculate the ""extent of use"" by multiplying the total consumption or generation at a busbar by the marginal current variations, or power to current distribution factors (PIDFs) that an increment of active and reactive power consumed, or generated in the case of distributed generation, at each busbar, produces in each circuit. These PIDFs are analogous to power transfer distribution factors (PTDFs). Unlike traditional tariff designs that average fixed costs on a per kWh basis across all customers, the proposed method provides more cost-reflective price signals and helps eliminate possible cross-subsidies that deter profitable (in the case of competition) or cost-effective (in the case of a fully regulated industry) deployment of DG by directly accounting for use and location in the allocation of fixed costs. An application of this method for a rural radial distribution network is presented. © 2006 IEEE."

Samples were scanned in the visible and near-infrared region of the spectra on a monochromator instrument (400-2500 nm) on both intact and homogenised presentation to the instrument. Two mathematical treatments (first and second derivative) and two scatter transformations to the spectra were explored, none and standard normal variate and detrend (SNV-D). Predictive (VIS/NIRS) calibrations were developed using a modified partial least-squares regression (mPLS) with internal cross validation. The highest coefficients of determination in calibration (Rcal2) and lower standard errors in cross validation (SECV) were found for both CIE L* and a*, in homogenised presentation, while poor calibration statistics were found on intact presentation. © 2003 Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology.

This modification route consists of the formation/deposition of a biomimetic polydopamine anchor layer followed by a well-controlled surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization of antifouling polymer brushes initiated by 2-bromo-2- methylpropanoyl groups covalently attached to the hydroxyl and amine groups present in the anchor layer. In this way, we synthesized polymer brushes of methoxy- and hydroxy-capped oligoethylene glycol methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate and carboxybetaine acrylamide. Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) indicated well-controlled polymerization kinetics of the brushes, thus the thickness of the ultra-thin films could be precisely tuned at a nanometer scale. The covalent structure and organization of the brushes grown from the polydopamine anchor layer were accessed by infrared reflection-adsorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) while the change in hydrophilicity caused by the presence of the brush was determined by dynamic water contact angle measurements. Surface plasmon resonance as well as ex situ IRRAS and SE measurements were applied to investigate the adsorption of model protein solutions and undiluted human blood plasma to the brushes. The biomimetic brushes completely suppressed the fouling from single protein solutions and reduced the fouling from plasma to less than 3% from the fouling measured on bare gold surfaces. The proposed modification procedure is non-destructive and does not require any chemical pre-activation or the presence of reactive groups on the substrate surface. Contrary to other antifouling modifications the coating can be performed on various classes of substrates and preserves its properties even in undiluted blood plasma. This work offers a promising technology for the facile fabrication of different surface-based biotechnological and biomedical devices able to perform tailor-made functions while resisting the fouling from the complex biological media where they operate. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry."

This insight has potential to improve tracking of disease progression and to aid in vascular graft design and implementation. In this study, we use linear and nonlinear viscoelastic models to predict biomechanical properties of the thoracic descending aorta and the carotid artery under ex vivo and in vivo conditions in ovine and human arteries. Models analyzed include a four-parameter (linear) Kelvin viscoelastic model and two five-parameter nonlinear viscoelastic models (an arctangent and a sigmoid model) that relate changes in arterial blood pressure to the vessel cross-sectional area (via estimation of vessel strain). These models were developed using the framework of Quasilinear Viscoelasticity (QLV) theory and were validated using measurements from the thoracic descending aorta and the carotid artery obtained from human and ovine arteries. In vivo measurements were obtained from 10 ovine aortas and 10 human carotid arteries. Ex vivo measurements (from both locations) were made in 11 male Merino sheep. Biomechanical properties were obtained through constrained estimation of model parameters. To further investigate the parameter estimates, we computed standard errors and confidence intervals and we used analysis of variance to compare results within and between groups. Overall, our results indicate that optimal model selection depends on the artery type. Results showed that for the thoracic descending aorta (under both experimental conditions), the best predictions were obtained with the nonlinear sigmoid model, while under healthy physiological pressure loading the carotid arteries nonlinear stiffening with increasing pressure is negligible, and consequently, the linear (Kelvin) viscoelastic model better describes the pressure-area dynamics in this vessel. Results comparing biomechanical properties show that the Kelvin and sigmoid models were able to predict the zero-pressure vessel radius; that under ex vivo conditions vessels are more rigid, and comparatively, that the carotid artery is stiffer than the thoracic descending aorta; and that the viscoelastic gain and relaxation parameters do not differ significantly between vessels or experimental conditions. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the proposed models can predict pressure-area dynamics and that model parameters can be extracted for further interpretation of biomechanical properties. © 2011 Biomedical Engineering Society."

The topography is a function of the full phase, whereas the measured phase is known modulo 2 π, necessitating the process of recovering full phase values via phase unwrapping. This mathematical process becomes difficult through the presence of noise and phase discontinuities. Our research is motivated by recent research that models phase unwrapping as a network flow minimization problem. The cost function to be optimized is a weighted L1-norm of the phase discontinuities. Determining these cost weights is critical, yet past work in the literature does not reflect the statistics of the unwrapping problem. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new method to compute the flow weights from a theoretical foundation. Specifically, we formulate phase unwrapping as a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation problem, which we mathematically rewrite as a network flow problem with a specific choice of weights. The approach is based on estimating the probability of phase discontinuities, which can be derived as a function of coherence and topographic slope from the known statistical properties of SAR phase."

In particular, the PBE and HSE06 density functionals were utilized. The comparison of the band gaps obtained with both functionals indicated that the band gaps at the PBE level are only slightly smaller than those obtained with HSE06. Specifically, the deviation variation was much smaller than that observed for carbon nanotubes or graphane. Phosphorus doping is somewhat more effective in opening larger optical gaps. The latter decreases very fast, upon lowering of dopant concentration. In the case of S-doping, for a doping concentration smaller than 0.5 at.%, the gaps are close to 0.1-0.2 eV, making the material not too attractive to develop graphene based electronics. However, for phosphorus doping, a dopant concentration of 0.5% is still useful as band gaps close to 0.3-0.4 eV are expected. Further work must be devoted to obtain larger band gaps by doping graphene with heteroatoms, which are necessary to develop graphene based electronics. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The objective of this paper is the combination of the two methods for treating convective terms which are derivatives of the problem variable. First the formulation of the methods for mixed Neumann-Dirichlet boundary conditions is considered, as both these types of boundary condition are necessary for this type of problem. Next a formulation for the usual Crank-Nickleson and Galerkin time-stepping procedures is obtained for both diffusion and diffusion-convection and the use of the subdomain technique with MFS is considered. Finally results obtained for some test problems are presented including a diffusion convection problem with variable velocity using both a single domain and a division into subregions, the convective terms being modeled using DRM.

In this context, consumer profiling techniques have increased their popularity in the last decade. The aim of the present work was to compare four consumer profiling techniques (sorting, projective mapping, intensity scales and check-all-that-apply questions) in orange-flavoured powdered juice drinks. A consumer study was carried out with 200 regular consumers of the category, which were divided into four groups. Each group used a different methodology to evaluate seven commercial powdered drinks. After completing the task consumers were asked to rate its difficulty on a nine-point hedonic scale. Results showed that the four evaluated methodologies were able to identify differences in consumers' perception of the sensory characteristics of the drinks, providing similar information. However, the application of CATA questions and intensity scales was regarded as easier for consumers. Advantages and disadvantages of the evaluated methodologies are discussed. © 2011 The Authors.

GB treatment improved the tolerance of C. infirmominiatum to oxidative stress. Compared to untreated control yeast cells, GB-treated cells showed less accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a lower level of protein oxidation in response to oxidative stress. Additionally, GB-treated yeast exhibited greater biocontrol activity against Penicillium expansum and a faster growth in wounds of apple fruits stored at 25°C compared to the performance of untreated yeast.

Here we address the problem of lake eutrophication (that is, nutrient enrichment leading to algal blooms) using a simple spatial lake model. We discuss and compare different spatial and temporal early warning signals announcing the catastrophic transition of an oligotrophic lake to eutrophic conditions. In particular, we consider the spatial variance and its associated patchiness of eutrophic water regions. We found that spatial variance increases as the lake approaches the point of transition to a eutrophic state. We also analyze the spatial and temporal early warnings in terms of the amount of information required by each and their respective forewarning times. From the consideration of different remedial procedures that can be followed after these early signals we conclude that some of these indicators are not early enough to avert the undesired impending shift. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company."

Although it is widely recognized that growth of diverse non-. Saccharomyces (NS) yeast can positively affect flavor complexity during . Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine fermentation, the inability to control spontaneous or co-fermentation processes by NS yeast has restricted their use in winemaking. We selected two NS yeasts from our Uruguayan native collection to study NS-. S. cerevisiae interactions during wine fermentation. The selected strains of . Hanseniaspora vineae and . Metschnikowia pulcherrima had different yeast assimilable nitrogen consumption profiles and had different effects on . S. cerevisiae fermentation and growth kinetics. Studies in which we varied inoculum size and using either simultaneous or sequential inoculation of NS yeast and . S. cerevisiae suggested that competition for nutrients had a significant effect on fermentation kinetics. Sluggish fermentations were more pronounced when . S. cerevisiae was inoculated 24. h after the initial stage of fermentation with a NS strain compared to co-inoculation. Monitoring strain populations using differential WL nutrient agar medium and fermentation kinetics of mixed cultures allowed for a better understanding of strain interactions and nutrient addition effects. Limitation of nutrient availability for . S. cerevisiae was shown to result in stuck fermentations as well as to reduce sensory desirability of the resulting wine. Addition of diammonium phosphate (DAP) and a vitamin mix to a defined medium allowed for a comparison of nutrient competition between strains.

These constraints, one for each pixel of the image, express the fact that the variance of the noise can be estimated from the residuals z-h*U if we use a neighborhood of each pixel. This is motivated by the fact that the usual inclusion of the image acquisition model as a single constraint expressing a bound for the variance of the noise does not give satisfactory results if we wish to simultaneously recover textured regions and obtain a good denoising of the image.

While the use of viruses and virus-like particles is limited by severe constraints, the generation of protein-only nanocarriers is progressively reachable by the engineering of protein-protein interactions, resulting in self-Assembling functional building blocks. In particular, end-terminal cationic peptides drive the organization of structurally diverse protein species as regular nanosized oligomers, offering promise in the rational engineering of protein self-Assembling. However, the in vivo stability of these constructs, being a critical issue for their medical applicability, needs to be assessed. We have explored here if the cross-molecular contacts between protein monomers, generated by end-terminal cationic peptides and oligohistidine tags, are stable enough for the resulting nanoparticles to overcome biological barriers in assembled form. The analyses of renal clearance and biodistribution of several tagged modular proteins reveal long-term architectonic stability, allowing systemic circulation and tissue targeting in form of nanoparticulate material. This observation fully supports the value of the engineered of protein building blocks addressed to the biofabrication of smart, robust, and multifunctional nanoparticles with medical applicability that mimic structure and functional capabilities of viral capsids. © 2014 American Chemical Society."

The evolution of the simulated time series with the fuel-air equivalence ratio, φ, from lean mixtures to over stoichiometric conditions, is examined and compared with previous experiments. Fluctuations on the characteristic length of unburned eddies are found to be essential to simulate the cycle-to-cycle heat release variations and recover experimental results.

Results show that the electrodeposition potential controls the growth of nickel nanowires along some preferential crystallographic planes. At -0.90 V (vs. Ag/AgCI) single crystalline nanowires with a strong (111) orientation were obtained. High temperatures and a moderately acid pH solution contributed to improve the single crystalline character of nanowires. The presence of chloride ions produced polycrystalline nanowires at low temperature and single crystalline nanowires at high temperature.

Our decomposition is designed so that the effects of using coincident peak and location for fixed network charges, as well as using marginal losses under constraints recovering the exact amount of losses, and recovering exactly the cost of network service in total can be isolated and analyzed separately. We apply our tariff transition and decomposition method to an example network with data from Uruguay to isolate the various effects with and without a distributed generation (DG) resource.We show moving to coincident peak charges and to fully charging for marginal losses while rebating the merchandising surplus through the fixed charges have the greatest effects on changes in distribution tariff charges. DG provides countervailing cost changes to distribution tariffs for loads through loss reductions and the implicit ""creation"" of new network capacity for which it is paid.

Recently, however, the use of the r function has been questioned both in relation to accuracy and in relation to the number and position of internal nodes required to obtain satisfactory solutions. Much research has been done in an attempt to fix criteria for choosing which approximation function should be used. One of the alternatives recently suggested is the augmented thin plate spline function, which consists of a thin plate spline function, r2 log(r), augmented with the first three terms of a Pascal triangle expansion. In this paper families of similar functions are obtained by augmenting radial basis functions with appropriate global expansions: these functions will be called hybrid approximate functions. It will be shown that using an appropriate hybrid function accurate results can be obtained for many body forces or pseudo body forces in elasticity without the need for internal nodes. © 1997 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd."

We focus on emerging spectrum agile wireless networks, where developing an efficient strategy for managing available communication resources is of high importance. The proposed dynamic resource management approach for wireless multimedia changes the passive way stations are currently adapting their joint source-channel coding strategies according to available wireless resources. Each wireless station can play the resource management game by adapting its multimedia transmission strategy depending on the experienced channel conditions and user requirements. The resource allocation game is coordinated by a network moderator, which deploys mechanism-based resource management to determine the amount of transmission time to be allocated to various users on different frequency bands such that certain global system metrics are optimized. Subsequently, the moderator charges the various users based on the amount of resources it has allocated to them, in order to discourage them from being dishonest about their resource requirements. We investigate and quantify both the users' and the system performance when different cross-layer strategies, and hence users' levels of smartness, are deployed by wireless stations.

Purity and stoichiometry of the starting material were determined by ICP and wet techniques. Films were grown onto 2 in ×2 in glass substrates with palladium as rear electrode. Lead-iodide films were grown by evaporating the starting material at 460°C in high-purity Ar atmosphere (600 mmHg) for 1 to 4 days, depending on the film thickness. The substrate temperature was prefixed from 200 to 250°C. Film thickness was measured by transmission of the 59.5 keV radiation from 241Am giving values from 35 to 50 μm (5%). Optical microscopy was performed on the films for determining crystallinity and grain size. Films were characterized by X-ray diffraction and texture was calculated as [∑I(00l)]/[∑I(hkl)]. Correlations between grain size, crystallinity, and growth-preferred orientation along the c-axis perpendicular to the substrate with substrate temperature were confirmed. The texture of the films strongly increases with substrate temperature, and films with texture of about 90% were obtained. Correlation between starting material purity and stoichiometry with epitaxial growth were also found. For measuring electrical and X-ray response properties detectors were assembled by front palladium thermal deposition, palladium wire attachment, and acrylic encapsulation. Resistivity values of 5 × 1014 Ω.cm and current density values of 5 pA/cm2 at 30 V were obtained. X-ray film response was checked by irradiating with an X-ray beam, giving linear response with exposure rate and sensitivities of about 0.35 μC/R.cm2. Again, a correlation between electrical properties with the substrate temperature and epitaxial growth was confirmed. Finally, results were compared with previous ones for the same and alternative materials."

Films have been grown with areas up to 80 cm2 (4″ diameter) and thickness of 20-250 μm using sublimation. The growth techniques used can be easily extended to produce much larger film areas (&gt;10″×10″). Thickness of the grown layers and size of the grains can be regulated over a wide range by adjusting the growth parameters. The films were characterized with respect to their electrical properties and in response to ionizing radiation. Leakage current as low as 40 pA/cm2 at the operating bias voltage of ∼50 V has been observed. High sensitivity and excellent linearity in the response to x-rays was measured. Signals from these HgI2 polycrystalline detectors, in response to ionizing radiation, compare favorably to the best published results for all high Z polycrystalline films grown elsewhere, including TlBr, PbI2 and HgI2. The low dark current, good sensitivity, and linearity of the response to x-rays put HgI2 polycrystalline semiconductor detectors in position as a leading candidate material for use in digital x-ray imaging systems.

In this sense, the failure mechanism could be modified so that the concrete exhibits a more brittle behaviour. This paper discusses the effects of rice-husk ash (RHA) additions to concrete, based on analyses of the mechanical behaviour of normal and high-strength concrete. The stress-strain response in compression and load vs. CMOD (or deflection) in bending were analysed. It appears that the incorporation of RHA in concrete increases the strength, particularly for lower water/binder ratio concretes. The analysis of the failure mechanism indicates a tendency for more brittle failure behaviour in RHA concretes. For the same strength level, however, the energy of fracture was reduced no more than 10%, which is much smaller than the variations that may be produced by a change in the type or size of coarse aggregate. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The species identity and trichothecene toxin potential of 151 FGSC isolates collected from wheat in Uruguay were determined via multilocus genotyping. Although F. graminearum with the 15ADON trichothecene type accounted for 86% of the isolates examined, five different FGSC species and all three trichothecene types were identified in this collection. This is the first report of Fusarium asiaticum, Fusarium brasilicum, Fusarium cortaderiae, and Fusarium austroamericanum from Uruguay. In addition, we observed significant (P<. 0.001) regional differences in the composition of FGSC species and trichothecene types within Uruguay. Isolates of F. graminearum with the 15ADON type were the most prevalent in western provinces (95%), while F. asiaticum (43%) and the NIV type (61%) predominated in the new wheat production zone in Cerro Largo along Uruguay's eastern border with Brazil. F. graminearum isolates (15ADON type) were significantly (P<. 0.005) more aggressive on wheat than were isolates from the other species examined (NIV or 3ADON types). However, F. graminearum isolates (15ADON type) were significantly (P<. 0.05) more sensitive to tebuconazole than isolates from other species (NIV type). These results document substantial heterogeneity among the pathogens responsible for FHB in Uruguay. In addition, the regional predominance of the NIV trichothecene type is of significant concern to food safety and indicates that additional monitoring of nivalenol levels in grain may be required. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

The main generalization with respect to standard IP is to allow routers to split their traffic in a controlled way between the outgoing links. We formulate global optimization criteria, combining those used in the congestion control and traffic engineering, and propose decentralized controllers at sources and routers to reach these optimal points, based on congestion price feedback. We first consider adapting the traffic splits at routers to follow the negative price gradient; we prove this is globally stabilizing when combined with primal congestion control, but can exhibit oscillations in the case of dual congestion control. We then propose an alternative anticipatory control of routing, proving its stability for the case of dual congestion control. We present a concrete implementation of such algorithms, based on queueing delay as congestion price. We use TCP-FAST for congestion control and develop a multipath variant of the distance vector routing protocol RIP. We demonstrate through ns2-simulations the collective behavior of the system, in particular that it reaches the desired equilibrium points. © 2009 IEEE."

The model captures both the economic and physical aspects of the pricing process, considering two sources of uncertainty: availability of the units and demand. This work is based on three oligopoly models-Bertrand, Cournot, and supply function equilibrium (SFE) due to Rudkevich, Duckworth, and Rosen-and obtains closed form expressions for expected value and variance of electricity hourly prices and average price. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the number of firms, anticipated peak demand, and price elasticity of demand. The results show that as the number of firms in the market decreases, the expected values of prices increase by a significant amount. Variances for the Cournot model also increase, but the variances for the SFE model decrease, taking even smaller values than Bertrand's. Thus, if the Rudkevich model is an accurate representation of the electricity market, the results show that an introduction of competition may decrease the expected value of prices but the variances may actually increase. Finally, using a refinement of the model, it has been demonstrated that an accurate temperature forecast can reduce significantly the prediction error of the electricity prices. © 2007 IEEE."

The migration from a Lagrangian implementation to a Eulerian one via implicit representations or level-sets brought some of the main advantages of the technique, i.e., topology independence and stability. This migration means also that the evolution is parametrization free. Therefore, we do not know exactly how each part of the shape is deforming and the point-wise correspondence is lost. In this note we present a technique to numerically track regions on surfaces that are being deformed using the level-sets method. The basic idea is to represent the region of interest as the intersection of two implicit surfaces and then track its deformation from the deformation of these surfaces. This technique then solves one of the main shortcomings of the very useful level-sets approach. Applications include lesion localization in medical images, region tracking in functional MRI (fMRI) visualization, and geometric surface mapping."

The dependence of the ionic conductivity of PVP/LiClO4 films on temperature, lithium salt concentration, and residual solvent content or humidity has been studied. The films were used in a symmetrical supercapacitor (PEDOT/PVP/PEDOT). Whose behaviour with the aging time was analysed as well. It was observed that the experimental differences in the performance of a lithium ion based energy storage devices using these films as solid electrolyte may be due to changes in the residual content of the solvent used in their preparation or the hygroscopic nature of the electrolyte. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

They are intended for long term use to control assistive technologies such as muscle stimulators or prosthetics that compensate for loss of function due to injury. Here we present a novel design of interface for peripheral nerves. Recording from axons is complicated by the small size of extracellular potentials and the concentration of current flow at nodes of Ranvier. Confining axons to microchannels of ∼100 μm diameter produces amplified potentials that are independent of node position. After implantation of microchannel arrays into rat sciatic nerve, axons regenerated through the channels forming 'mini-fascicles', each typically containing ∼100 myelinated fibres and one or more blood vessels. Regenerated motor axons reconnected to distal muscles, as demonstrated by the recovery of an electromyogram and partial prevention of muscle atrophy. Efferent motor potentials and afferent signals evoked by muscle stretch or cutaneous stimulation were easily recorded from the mini-fascicles and were in the range of 35-170 μV. Individual motor units in distal musculature were activated from channels using stimulus currents in the microampere range. Microchannel interfaces are a potential solution for applications such as prosthetic limb control or enhancing recovery after nerve injury. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd."

In this work, the varietal effect on the anthocyanins extraction was studied, considering a series of fermentation on skins of Tannat, Cabernet-Sauvignon and Merlot. The different anthocyanic structures have a different diffusion in the must, at least during first stages of maceration. The decrease of the proportions of cyanidin and peonidin during the first days, with a consequent increase of the malvidin and petunidin proportions was verified. The coumarates proportions increased after the first day of maceration in all the musts. However, the definitive proportions of each anthocyanic form are reached rapidly and remain constant after the second or third day of maceration. The anthocyanic fingerprint of the young wines obtained in classical fermentation on skins is characteristic of each grape variety, although their evolution follows the general tendencies indicated. © 2007 Springer-Verlag."

In particular, for problems with singularities of any kind the determination of the optimal placement of source points becomes relevant, as no linear combination of arbitrarily located source points can guarantee a reasonable approximation to the solution. This paper investigates the use of a ""Simulated Annealing"" algorithm in the optimal placement of source points in singular problems. The algorithm is essentially an iterative random search with adaptive moves along the coordinate directions. It permits uphill moves under the control of a probabilistic criterion, thus tending to avoid the first local minima encountered. The proposed methodology is employed with a variety of test problems. Results are compared to those of an analytical optimisation routine and their relatively merits and disadvantages discussed. Simulated annealing is shown to be an attractive option for the optimisation of singular problems, with a high rate of success, and able to solve problems for which analytical optimisation routines fail."

Multiple factor analysis (MFA) was carried out on a data matrix that contained the percentage of positive samples, type of juice, raw material and production year.Except for kiwi and orange, Alicyclobacillus was found in juices from all the evaluated raw materials. The highest percentage of positive samples was found for beetroot, strawberry, banana, peach, mango, carrot and plum juices. The percentage of positive samples for these juices ranged from 100% to 24%.Furthermore, the application of multivariate techniques provided an insight on the relationship between the incidence of Alicyclobacillus and production variables. This approach enabled the identification of the most relevant variables that increased the percentage of positive samples among the juices, which could help in developing strategies to avoid the incidence of this bacterium.By means of hierarchical cluster analysis seven groups (clusters) of juices which showed different percentages of positive samples for Alicyclobacillus spp. were identified. This analysis showed that pineapple, peach, strawberry, mango and beetroot juices had higher rates of positivity for Alicyclobacillus than the rest of the evaluated juices. MFA analysis also showed that some clear relationships could be highlighted between the percentage of samples positive for Alicyclobacillus and five types of fruit juices (strawberry, beetroot, grapefruit, pineapple and mango). It was observed that a large proportion of juices produced in 2000, 2005 and 2008 were located in clusters with higher incidence of Alicyclobacillus spp., whereas a larger proportion of clarified concentrate juice and concentrate pulp samples showed higher probability of incidence of Alicyclobacillus in these products.

The ZnO seed layer was prepared by a sol-gel process from different precursor solutions and deposited onto FTO/glass by spin coating. Afterwards, NW were electrochemically grown onto those seed layers. The electrolyte was an aqueous solution of the Zn +2 precursor (1 mM zinc acetate) and a supporting electrolyte (0.1 M sodium acetate), saturated with bubbling oxygen. The films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and optical transmittance. The XRD measurements show typical diffraction pattern of ZnO wurtzite structure. The SEM micrographs show the presence of smooth NW with hexagonal sections with diameters ranging from 40 to 250 nm. The optical transmittance reveals the presence of ZnO with bandgap energy between 3.23 and 3.29 eV. These spectra show a monotonically increasing transmittance from the UV into the red part of the spectrum. This feature may be originated in the dispersion of light at the NW and can be used to enhance below-gap absorption. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim."

Among the actively considered options, shingled writing is currently the most attractive one because it is the easiest to implement at the device level. Shingled write recording trades the inconvenience of the inability to update in-place for a much higher data density by a using a different write technique that overlaps the currently written track with the previous track. Random reads are still possible on such devices, but writes must be done largely sequentially. In this paper, we discuss possible changes to disk-based data structures that the adoption of shingled writing will require. We first explore disk structures that are optimized for large sequential writes with little or no sequential writing, even of metadata structures, while providing acceptable read performance. We also examine the usefulness of non-volatile RAM and the benefits of object-based interfaces in the context of shingled disks. Finally, through the analysis of recent device traces, we demonstrate the surprising stability of written device blocks, with general purpose workloads showing that more than 93% of device blocks remain unchanged over a day, and that for more specialized workloads less than 0.5% of a shingled-write disk's capacity would be needed to hold randomly updated blocks. ©2010 IEEE."

Although a large population of active yeast cells can be introduced in the inoculated wines, resulting in a complete fermentation, this does not necessarily mean an improvement of the sensory characteristics of the wines. The impact of the size of the inocula in wine quality parameters has been very little studied, and in no case the nutrient balance of the grape must utilized was taken into account.In this work we present results obtained for wine aroma compounds at three inoculum levels (104, 105 and 106cells/mL), and two different yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) in a white grape must, using two S. cerevisiae strains commonly used for winemaking. A significant effect in the final concentrations of higher alcohols, esters, fatty acids, free monoterpenes and lactones was attributed to the size of inoculum in both strains but not in an easily predictable way. However, a consistent increase of desired aroma compounds (esters, lactones and free monoterpenes), and a decrease of less desired compounds for white wine (higher alcohols and medium chain fatty acids), was shown at inoculum sizes of 105cells/mL for both strains in real winemaking conditions. In a discriminant analysis six aroma compounds discriminate the three inoculum sizes for all wine samples: 1,8-terpine, hodiol I (trans-3,7-dimethyl-1,5-octadiene-3,7-diol), isobutyl alcohol, iso C4 acid, ethyl C6 ester and C8 acid. © 2010 Elsevier B.V."

In order to show the applicability of the methodology some goodness-of-fit tests based on these ideas are designed.

Since it may be necessary to comply with the regulations at a different (remote) place with respect to the active filter location, the optimization method has been extended to this case. In order to validate the simulations, measurements which were made at a real application-an arc furnace-were used. Finally, the simulated results obtained with a optimized remote hybrid selective filter were compared with those obtained when a shunt active filter is installed directly at the place where the harmonic emission regulations must be met. The comparison shows that optimized remote compensation is an alternative to be seriously considered because it allows the installation of the active filter at the source of harmonic injection (distorting load). © 2004 IEEE."

The technique can be applied to abject tracking and slice-by-slice segmentation of 3D data. The topology of the deforming curve can change, without any special topology handling procedures added to the scheme. This permits for example the automatic tracking of scenes where, due to occlusions, the topology of the objects of interest changes from frame to frame."

The bed is modelled as a viscoelastic body using the Voigt model. The model's results on interface shear stress and wave damping show acceptable agreement when compared to laboratory data. This model is an extension of the one developed by MacPherson [3], since it considers the continuity of the shear stress through the watermud interface, taking into account a thin water boundary layer upon the interface. It can be concluded that: a. the wave damping coefficient can be one or two orders higher than the one corresponding to the rigid bed theory, and it depends on the mud's elasticity; b. the interface shear stress can be higher or lower than the one calculated when the bed is considered rigid; and it depends on mud properties, wave frequency and mud depth; c. the system's resonance (i.e. when the interface and surface amplitude rate approaches 1) can occur when the elasticity is >0, and the peak frequency depends on the system's physical parameters. © 1993 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

The nanoparticles acted as physical cross-linkers resulting in excellent mechanical resistance. The effects of composition such as the amount of nanoclay and the HEMA/CBMAA-3 molar ratio on the physical properties of the nanocomposite hydrogels were investigated. These gels showed outstanding composition-dependent mechanical properties, exhibiting remarkably large elongations at break (≥1800%) and high strengths and moduli even at higher molar contents of CBMAA-3 and higher degrees of swelling (DS).

A wide spectrum of functional peptides has been incorporated to different types of nanoparticles for the delivery of conventional drugs and nucleic acids, enabling receptor-specific cell binding and internalization, endosomal escape, cytosolic trafficking, nuclear targeting and DNA condensation. However, the development of architectonic tags to induce the self-assembling of functionalized monomers has been essentially neglected. We have examined here the nanoscale architectonic capabilities of arginine-rich cationic peptides, that when displayed on His-tagged proteins, promote their self-assembling as monodisperse, protein-only nanoparticles. The scrutiny of the cross-molecular interactivity cooperatively conferred by poly-arginines and poly-histidines has identified regulatable electrostatic interactions between building blocks that can also be engineered to encapsulate cargo DNA. The combined use of cationic peptides and poly-histidine tags offers an unusually versatile approach for the tailored design and biofabrication of protein-based nano-therapeutics, beyond the more limited spectrum of possibilities so far offered by self-assembling amyloidogenic peptides. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

Surgical reconstruction of the common carotid artery (CA) is performed in several clinical situations, using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis (ePTFE) or saphenous vein (SV) grafts. At date there is interest in obtaining an arterial graft that improves the results of that nowadays available. The use of a fresh or cryopreserved/defrosted artery appears as an interesting alternative. However, if the fresh and cryopreserved/defrosted arteries allow an adequate viscoelastic and functional matching with the host arteries needs to be established. The aims were to compare the viscoelastic and functional performance of: (1) conduits used in CA reconstruction (SV and ePTFE) with those of the fresh and cryopreserved/defrosted CA and femoral arteries (FA), and (2) normotensive and hypertensive patients' arteries with those of the arterial substitutes in vitro analyzed. Pressure, diameter and wall thickness of the CA were recorded in 15 normotensive and 15 hypertensive patients (in vivo studies), and in SV, fresh and cryopreserved/defrosted CA and FA (obtained from 15 donors), and ePTFE segments (in vitro studies). From stress-strain relationship we calculated elastic and viscous modulus, and the characteristic impedance. The local buffer and conduit functions were quantified as the viscous/elastic quotient and the inverse of the characteristic impedance.

The best growth conditions were a source temperature of 120°C, a growth temperature of 60°C and a growth time of 24 h, with an initial pressure of 6 × 10-3 Pa. Film thicknesses and grain sizes gave values ranging between 100 and 260 μm (10%), and between (10 ± 5) and (30 ± 10) μm, respectively. Films grew oriented with the (0 0 l) crystalline planes parallel to the substrate, with a texture of 0.94, measured by X-ray powder diffraction. The dark current density of the films is lower than 0.3 pA/mm2 for electric fields below 0.4 V/μm, and their resistivity is 1.5 × 10 14 Ω.cm. Mobility-lifetime values of 5.2 × 10 -6 cm2/V and 6.2 × 10-6 cm2/V can be estimated for electrons and holes, respectively. Films give a sensitivity to X-rays of 37 nC/R.cm2. A signal to dark relation of 1120 was measured at 750 mR/s and 32 KVp, with an electric field of 0.4 V/μm applied to the film.

Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) was employed for evaluating the dopant concentration and foreign impurities. Low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed on the crystals in the 1.2-1.6 eV energy range. The crystals electrical properties were studied by Hall and I-V measurements. (D-X) and (DAP) lines dominate the PL spectra for CdTe crystals, suggesting n-type conductivity and the presence of a compensation mechanism due to the heavy metal dopant incorporation. Investigating the 1.4 eV band, we obtained the Huang-Rhys parameter, the principal energy of zero phonon line and the energy of longitudinal optical phonon for each dopant.

In addition, the use of sliding block interfaces allows the incorporation of moving rigid bodies inside the flow domain. An algebraic multigrid solver has been developed that works with this block structured approach, speeding up the iterations for the pressure.

Close to threshold a VCSEL operates on the fundamental transverse mode, while for larger injection the dynamics is often multimode, with the optical feedback inducing either in-phase or anti-phase transverse mode oscillations. In this paper, we study numerically the influence of current modulation on these different feedback-induced transverse-mode regimes. The modulation amplitude and period are taken as control parameters. We find that the in-phase and anti-phase regimes are robust under weak modulation. As the modulation amplitude increases, there is a transition to a dynamics governed by the current modulation, where the total output power follows the injection current and there is either single-mode or in-phase multimode behavior. However, the effect of the current modulation depends on the modulation period. Under fast modulation, the laser cannot follow the modulation and the optical-feedback-induced effects are dominant. On the contrary, under slow modulation there is a superposition of modulation and feedback effects, with the total output following the modulated current and an underlying transverse-mode behavior mainly determined by the optical feedback. A resonant behavior was observed for modulation periods close to the internal oscillation period. In this case, current modulation induces pulsing output intensity with single-mode or in-phase multimode behavior."

The highest concentration of tocochromanols was found in pomegranate seed oil (398.73mg/100g) and the lowest in gooseberry seed oil (69.13mg/100g). The γ and α homologues were the predominant forms of tocopherol and tocotrienol in all fruit seed oils studied. The pomegranate, canary melon, watermelon, gooseberry and red currants seed oils contained mainly γ-tocopherol (382.69, 63.08, 111.01, 60.35, and 156.39mg/100g, respectively). In the apple, sea buckthorn and Japanese quince seed oils, α-tocopherol was the predominant tocochromanol (58.77, 121.79, and 198.94mg/100g, respectively). High concentrations of tocotrienol homologes (γ and α) (49.49 and 34.53mg/100g, respectively) were found only in grape seed oil. A significant correlation (r=0.994, p<0.00001) between the total content of tocochromanols in the seed oils and scavenging of the free radical DPPH was found. Practical applications: This study demonstrated that seed oils recovered from industrial fruit by-products generated by the food industry are valuable source of tocochromanols. Therefore, fruit seed oils may be successfully applied to obtain new products rich in vitamin E for the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, with environmental sustainability benefits and a more effective use of harvested plant material. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This statement is supported by a systematic study where the MOST is analyzed in all-inversion regions using an exhaustive CS-LNA noise-figure (NF)-power-consumption optimization technique with power gain constraint. Effects of bias choke resistance and MOST capacitances are carefully included in the study to obtain more accurate results, especially for the MI-WI region. NF, power consumption, and gain versus the inversion region are described with design space maps, providing the designer with a deep insight of their tradeoffs. The Pareto-optimal design frontier obtained by calculation-showing the MI-WI region as the optimum design zone-is reverified by extensive electrical simulations of a high number of designs. Finally, one 90-nm 2.4-GHz CS-LNA Pareto optimal design is implemented. It achieves the best figure of merit considering under-milliwatt CS-LNAs published designs, consuming 684 μW, an NF of 4.36 dB, a power gain of 9.7 dB, and a third-order intermodulation intercept point of-4 dBm with load and source resistances of 50 Ω. © 2014 IEEE."

The nanowires presented high aspect ratio and exhibited a very high crystallinity with a wurtzite crystal structure with preferential orientation along the (0001) crystallographic axis. Chronoamperometric experiments were performed on gold bulk electrodes in order to model this preferential mode growth of ZnO nanowires, which has not been previously reported for similar precursors in DMSO solution. The analysis of the corresponding chronoamperograms revealed that chloride ions influence the oxide nucleation and growth mechanism. It was found that in the absence of KCl as a supporting electrolyte, the data fitted an instantaneous threedimensional diffusion-controlled (IN-3D)diff nucleation and growth mechanism (NGM). The presence of KCl, instead favored a progressive three-dimensional (PN-3D)diff NGM. With these results, a model for the more complex nanowire's growth inside the pores of the AAO template is proposed. © Springer-Verlag 2011."

The structure is assumed to have important geometric nonlinearity whereas the aerodynamics is assumed to be linear. This is a typical situation of airplane configurations in which geometric stiffness effects are important but deformations are moderate, flow is attached and linear aerodynamic modeling is adequate. Joined-wings, strut-braced, and low aspect ratio wings are possible applications. The approach proposed in this paper is to reduce the order of the system by adopting a basis of structural tangent modes reconstructed via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) as a function of the aerodynamic pressure. It is shown that the proposed procedure provides excellent results in the range of aerodynamic speeds used to build the basis of tangent modes. Extrapolation of the functions used to interpolate the POD coefficients and generate the modal basis has been proven to provide satisfactory results for planar wings. The extrapolation is more challenging when Joined Wings are considered. Copyright © 2010 by Luciano Demasi and Antonio Palacios."

By analyzing the error voltage and finding its correlation with the parameter error, a gradient algorithm is derived that makes the parameter error vanish and minimizes the voltage error.

It has also been applied as a model of cognitive processing and word-meaning acquisition. This dual importance of LSA derives from its capacity to modulate the meaning of words by contexts, dealing successfully with polysemy and synonymy. The underlying reasons that make the method work are not clear enough. We propose that the method works because it detects an underlying block structure (the blocks corresponding to topics) in the term-by-document matrix. In real cases this block structure is hidden because of perturbations. We propose that the correct explanation for LSA must be searched in the structure of singular vectors rather than in the profile of singular values. Using the Perron-Frobenius theory we show that the presence of disjoint blocks of documents is marked by sign-homogeneous entries in the vectors corresponding to the documents of one block and zeros elsewhere. In the case of nearly disjoint blocks, perturbation theory shows that if the perturbations are small, the zeros in the leading vectors are replaced by small numbers (pseudo-zeros). Since the singular values of each block might be very different in magnitude, their order does not mirror the order of blocks. When the norms of the blocks are similar, LSA works fine, but we propose that when the topics have different sizes, the usual procedure of selecting the first k singular triplets (k being the number of blocks) should be replaced by a method that selects the perturbed Perron vectors for each block. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast, the specialist's ability to understand, synthesize and take into account such information is severely constrained by the short time available for the appointments. Therefore, systems reusing available knowledge and implementing reasoning processes become critical to support the tasks of the doctors. As a number of different techniques for building such systems are available, contrasting their effectiveness becomes a major concern. This is especially important in the case of infectious diseases that can be lethal within hours such as the Acute Bacterial Meningitis (ABM) for which implementing and contrasting different techniques allows for an increased reliability and speed in supporting the process of diagnosis. This work focuses on the construction of diagnosis support tools for ABM, reporting a comparative assessment of the quality of a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) resulting from the application of Case Based Reasoning (CBR), to that of an existing CDSS system developed using a Bayesian expert system. Although both approaches proved to be useful, the one based in CBR techniques show some interesting capabilities as higher precision, automatic learning or experience capturing, and also a better response to lack of input data. The three developed systems perform with high levels of accuracy- e.g. propose correct diagnostics based on a certain set of symptoms - but the one based on CBR present some additional capabilities that look very promising for implementing these kind of systems in a real world scenario. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

The grapes of Tannat had the highest total phenolic richness (A280 = 80.0), total anthocyanin potential (ApH1 = 2540 mg L-1) and extractable anthocyanin potential (ApH3.2 = 1269 mg L-1), although there were important differences between the years. Representative winemaking of each vineyard was carried out. The differences verified in the grapes phenolic indexes were related to the colour and polyphenolic composition of the wines. The correlations between the phenolic indexes of the grapes and the colour and polyphenolic composition of the wines were very high. The estimation of the polyphenolic richness and the extractability of the anthocyanins of the grapes allow to improve the management of the winemaking and the prediction of the chromatic characteristics and the global polyphenolic composition of the wines. © 2010 The Authors.

Models compared include a Kelvin (standard linear) model and an extended 2-term exponential linear viscoelastic model. Models were validated against in-vitro data from the ovine thoracic descending aorta and the carotid artery. Measurements of blood pressure data were used as an input to predict ves- sel cross-sectional area. Material properties were predicted by estimating a set of model parameters that minimize the difference between computed and measured values of the cross-sectional area. The model comparison was carried out using generalized analysis of variance type statistical tests. For the thoracic descending aorta, results suggest that the extended 2-term exponential model does not improve the ability to predict the observed cross-sectional area data, while for the carotid artery the extended model does statistically provide an improved fit to the data. This is in agreement with the fact that the aorta displays more complex nonlinear viscoelastic dynamics, while the stiffer carotid artery mainly displays simpler linear viscoelastic dynamics. © 2009 Global Science Press."

The BM could be reduced using human cryopreserved/defrosted arteries (cryografts), but post-thaw cryografts' recovery could be associated with an impaired biomechanical behavior. In vitro, we demonstrated that our cryopreservation methods do not affect arteries' biomechanics, but only post-implant studies would allow determining the cryografts' biomechanical performance. Aim To characterize the biomechanical properties of implanted cryografts, and to compare them with cryografts pre-implant, recipients' native arteries, and arteries from subjects with characteristics similar to those of the recipients and multiorgan donors (MOD) whose arteries were cryopreserved. Methods Native femoral arteries anastomosed to cryografts, implanted cryografts, and arteries from subjects, recipient-like and MOD-like, were studied. In vitro (pre-implant cryografts) and in vivo non-invasive studies were performed. Arterial pressure, diameter, and wall thickness were obtained to quantify local and regional biomechanical parameters, and to evaluate the arterial remodeling. Conclusion Implanted cryografts were remodeled, with an increased wall thickness, wall-to-lumen ratio, and wall cross-sectional area. The proximal-distal gradual transition in stiffness remained unchanged. Implanted cryografts were stiffer than MOD-like arteries, but more compliant than recipients' arteries. The cryografts-native arteries biomechanical differences were lesser than those described for venous grafts or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. © 2009 Biomedical Engineering Society."

We analyze our approach using the recently proposed PSQA technology which allows to obtain an accurate (and automatic) numerical evaluation of the quality as perceived by each client. Our transmission technique includes the use of an arbitrary amount of redundancy in the signal, whose specification is a part of the dimensioning process, and it works with very low signaling overhead.

The aim was to compare the biomechanical behavior of veins and arteries from different regions and sizes under arterial conditions. In vitro pressure and diameter were measured in four different veins and three different ovine arteries. A diameter-pressure transfer function was designed, and compliance, viscous, and inertial indexes, and viscous energy and buffering function were calculated. Regional differences in vein mechanical behavior and energy dissipation were found. Veins and arteries vary in mechanical properties and buffering, but the differences were lesser when considering the smallest artery. The differences among veins' viscosity, compliance, and energy dissipation, but not in the buffering capability, could be related to different performances of veins when used as arterial grafts. The major biomechanical matching could contribute to explain veins with better results in small arteries reconstruction. © 2006, Copyright the Authors."

Platelets were grown from both synthesized lead iodide without purification, and purified by repeated evaporation. The growth was performed by heating the starting material under vacuum (10-5 mm Hg) or in high-purity Ar atmosphere (500 mm Hg) at temperatures from 390 to 440 °C, for 10 to 25 days. Platelets grew at 200-250 °C and perpendicular to the ampoule wall. Platelet size is up to 13 × 8 mm2, and their thickness is from 50 to 100 μm. Crystals were characterized by optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and low temperature photoluminescence. These characterizations showed that platelets have au exceptional transparence, that they grew from hexagonal grains, and that their surface has a mean roughness in the range from 1.1 to 4.7 nm. Low-temperature photoluminescence peak position and broadness confirmed the high purity of the starting material, and bands confirmed strong components from free and bonded excitons and low superficial imperfections. Electrical properties were measured by making radiation detectors with front palladium thermal deposition contacts and acrylic encapsulation. Resistivity values up to 4 × 1013 Ω.cm and current density values as low as 288 pA/cm2 (20 V) were obtained. X-ray spectrometry was performed with lead iodide detectors, and an energy resolution of 1.8 keV was achieved for the 241 Am 14 keV radiation. Correlation between optical and surface properties, electrical parameters, and detector performance are presented. Also, the different results were compared with previous ones for lead iodide crystals grown by other methods and with alternative materials."

Reheat and intercooling are two such schemes. The basic objective of introducing intercooling and reheat is to increase specific power and thermal efficiency. When comparing ideal and real cycles, the largest sources of loss in a gas turbine engine are those arising from the turbomachinery and the need to cool the turbine blades. In this paper the concepts of intercooling and reheat for gas turbines are assessed, in a systematic way, using a model that includes the above losses in order to evaluate their effects on the engine performance. Also examined is the choice of the position where intercooling or reheat is implemented which can have a large effect on the engine output. A comparison is made with the simple cycle and it is shown that these schemes show much promise. Some of the development difficulties are also outlined. Intercooling promises large improvements in efficiency over the simple cycle, especially at high pressure ratios. Reheat on the other hand is much more suited to combined cycles."

The algorithm here described is based on combining robust anisotropic diffusion with minimal weighted-path computations. After the image is regularized via anisotropic diffusion, the user clicks points on the boundary of the desired object, and the algorithm completes the boundary between those points. This tracing is based on computing paths of minimal weighted distance, where the weight is given by the image edge content. Thanks to advanced numerical algorithms, the algorithm is very fast and accurate.

We formulate a user-centric Network Utility Maximization problem that takes into account the aggregate rate a user obtains from all connections, and we propose decentralized means to achieve this fairness objective. In a first proposal, cooperative users control their number of active connections based on congestion prices from the transport layer to emulate suitable primal-dual dynamics in the aggregate rate; we show this control achieves asymptotic convergence to the optimal user-centric allocation. For the case of noncooperative users, we show that network stability and user-centric fairness can be enforced by a utility-based admission control implemented at the network edge. We also study stability and fairness issues when routing of incoming connections is enabled at the edge router. We obtain in this case a characterization of the stability region of loads that can be served with routing alone and a generalization of our admission control policy to ensure user-centric fairness when the stability condition is not met. The proposed algorithms are implemented at the packet level in ns2 and demonstrated through simulation. © 2013 IEEE."

However, controversies and variations exist in how research groups utilise TFA, causing high variability in interpretation. The objective of this study was to evaluate between-centre variability in TFA outcome metrics. 15 centres analysed the same 70 BP and CBFV datasets from healthy subjects (n= 50 rest; n= 20 during hypercapnia); 10 additional datasets were computer-generated. Each centre used their in-house TFA methods; however, certain parameters were specified to reduce a priori between-centre variability. Hypercapnia was used to assess discriminatory performance and synthetic data to evaluate effects of parameter settings. Results were analysed using the Mann-Whitney test and logistic regression. A large non-homogeneous variation was found in TFA outcome metrics between the centres. Logistic regression demonstrated that 11 centres were able to distinguish between normal and impaired CA with an AUC. >. 0.85. Further analysis identified TFA settings that are associated with large variation in outcome measures.These results indicate the need for standardisation of TFA settings in order to reduce between-centre variability and to allow accurate comparison between studies. Suggestions on optimal signal processing methods are proposed. © 2014 IPEM."

The estimation of such gain, however, relies on a double-loop integration. Moreover, its numerical integration in multi-dimensional cases, e.g., when using Monte Carlo sampling methods, is therefore computationally too expensive for realistic physical models, especially for those involving the solution of partial differential equations. In this work, we present a new methodology, based on the Laplace approximation for the integration of the posterior probability density function (pdf), to accelerate the estimation of the expected information gains in the model parameters and predictive quantities of interest. We obtain a closed-form approximation of the inner integral and the corresponding dominant error term in the cases where parameters are determined by the experiment, such that only a single-loop integration is needed to carry out the estimation of the expected information gain. To deal with the issue of dimensionality in a complex problem, we use a sparse quadrature for the integration over the prior pdf. We demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the proposed method via several nonlinear numerical examples, including the designs of the scalar parameter in a one-dimensional cubic polynomial function, the design of the same scalar in a modified function with two indistinguishable parameters, the resolution width and measurement time for a blurred single peak spectrum, and the boundary source locations for impedance tomography in a square domain. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

While we discuss several alternative layouts for use with SWD, we also discuss the dramatic implications of observed workloads. Example data access traces demonstrate the surprising stability of written device blocks, with a small fraction requiring multiple updates (the problematic operation for a shingled-write device). Specifically, we discuss how general purpose workloads can show that more than 93% of device blocks can remain unchanged over a day, and that for more specialized workloads less than 0.5% of a shingled-write disk's capacity would be needed to hold randomly updated blocks. We further demonstrate how different approaches to data layout can alternatively improve or reduce the performance of a shingled-write device in comparison to the performance of a traditional non-shingled device. © 2011 IEEE."

Melon pieces were subjected to hot (60 °C) or cold (5 °C) water dipping (60, 90, 120 s or 60 s, respectively) followed by immersion in 80 mg L- 1 peracetic acid (PAA) for 60 s at 5 °C or in water, packed in polypropylene trays under passive modified atmosphere (7.4 kPa O2 and 7.4 kPa CO2 at steady state), and stored up to 10 days at 5 °C. Respiration rate, ethylene emission, microbial load, flesh firmness, polyamine content and sensorial quality were determined. As main conclusions the longer HWD treatment times (90 and 120 s) followed by PAA dip, provided the lowest metabolic activity and helped to control microbial load without affecting the sensorial quality. In addition, both treatments increased the polyamine content helping to maintain the cell membranes integrity. Industrial relevance: Maintaining quality and microbial safety are the most important concerns of the fresh-cut fruit and vegetables industry. The present study focused on assessing the effect of HWD treatments alone or in combination with PAA, on the respiration rate, ethylene emission, microbial load, flesh firmness, polyamines content and quality retention of fresh-cut Galia melon. According to our results, the use of a heat treatment alone or combined with PAA could replace the use of chlorine, and could be a feasible alternative for fresh-cut industry as a sanitizing method, as or more effective as chlorine. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The nanosized Ce0.85Gd0.15O1.925 powder obtained by coprecipitation method was modified with Cr3+, Fe3+, Ni2+ or Cu2+ ions. Using high-intensity high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction data we have determined that Cr, Fe and Ni ions do not incorporate into the cerium gadolinium oxide surface or bulk when sintered at 1300 °C, but react with Gd ions to form Cr0.9Gd0.1O, GdFeO3 and GdNiO3 phases, while Cu incorporates in the material up to 0.7 mol% with a significant fraction of remaining material showing poorly crystalline CuO phase. The nanosized Ce0.85Gd0.15O1.925 material shows already improved sintering properties than previous reports but full sintering is not achieved below 1300 °C, however Cr, Fe and mainly Cu impregnation allows full sintering at 1300 °C. 0.5 mol% Ni impregnated material sintered at 1500 °C shows enhanced grain boundary conductivity that probably indicates that Ni incorporates into Ce0.84Gd0.15O1.925 above 1300 °C. The global results indicate, however, that optimization of ceria microstructure is at least of equal importance for sinterability and grain boundary conductivity than impregnation of the material with transition metal ions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A questionnaire was presented to consumers from two different Spanish-speaking countries (Spain and Uruguay, n = 200). The answers showed that the terms crispy and crunchy had different meanings or evoked different perceptions depending on the country. The crispy/crunchy food items most frequently mentioned by consumers were dry-crisp, processed products; vegetables or other wet-crisp products were not often mentioned by the consumers interviewed. The main difference between the two countries was that 38% of Spanish consumers did not know the Spanish term for ""crunchy"" and 17% thought that ""crispy"" and ""crunchy"" had the same meaning. The results contribute to a greater knowledge of the terminology used by the consumers to describe oral sensations related to crispness and crunchiness. © 2007 Springer-Verlag."

The structure was surrounded by water at high tide and subject to intense wave forcing. By positioning pressure sensors at different levels inside the soil, simultaneous time series of pore pressure measurements were acquired. They demonstrated that the sediment layer on top of the bed does not remain continuously in static equilibrium. Momentary liquefaction was observed as the occurrence of an upward pressure gradient, which could overcome the effective weight of the sediment layer. Using a Fourier analysis, a comparison was made with the theory put forward by Sakai in 1992 whereby the damping of pore pressure variations inside the soil can be quantified. This indicated the existence of a significant amount of gas inside the soil, which was confirmed in the field by geoendoscopic videos. © 2007 ASCE."

Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to classify the samples based on their NIR spectra according to their geographical origin. Full cross validation was used as validation method when classification models were developed. The overall classification rates obtained were 76 and 100% using PLS-DA and LDA, respectively.

This is a particular problem in large-scale carrier networks, for which efficient, accurate and stable methods for Traffic Matrix modeling and estimation are vital and challenging to conceive. In the short-term, estimation methods must be efficient and stable to allow crucial real-time tasks such as on-line traffic monitoring. In the long-term, methods must provide an accurate picture of the traffic matrix to tackle problems such as network planning, design, and dimensioning. In this paper we present and compare two efficient methods for on-line traffic matrix estimation. Based on an original parsimonious linear model for traffic flows in large-scale networks, we present a simple approach to compute an accurate traffic matrix from easily available link traffic measurements. We further extend the validation of this parsimonious model to three operational backbone networks. We analyze in depth a method to recursively estimate the traffic matrix, studying the drawbacks and omissions of the former algorithm and proposing new extensions to solve these problems. We finally perform a comparative analysis of the performance of both methods in two operational backbone networks, taking into account significant aspects such as accuracy, stability, scalability, and on-line applicability."

A new heuristic based on the GRASP metaheuristic is proposed to solve the TNDP. As a multi-objective metaheuristic, it produces in a single run a set of non-dominated solutions representing different trade-off levels between the conflicting objectives of users and operators. Previous approaches have dealt with the multi-objective nature of the problem by weighting the different objectives into a single objective function. The case proposed by Mandl is used to show that the multi-objective metaheuristic is capable of producing a diverse set of solutions, which are compared with solutions obtained by other authors. We show that the proposed algorithm produces more non-dominated solutions than the Weighted Sum Method with the same computational effort, using the case of Mandl and another real test case. © 2010 Springer-Verlag."

However, one of the drawbacks of this concept is the decrease in its performance throughout the time. The objective of this paper is to present a new thermocline-like storage concept, which aims at circumventing this issue. The proposed concept consists of a storage tank filled with a combination of solid material and encapsulated PCMs, forming a multi-layered packed bed, with molten salt as the heat transfer fluid. The performance evaluation of each of the prototypes proposed is virtually tested by means of a detailed numerical methodology which considers the heat transfer and fluid dynamics phenomena present in these devices. The virtual tests carried out are designed so as to take into account several charging and discharging cycles until periodic state is achieved, i.e. when the same amount of energy is stored/released in consecutive charging/discharging cycles. As a result, the dependence of the storage capacity on the PCMs temperatures, the total energy and exergy stored/released, as well as the efficiencies of the storing process are compared for the different thermocline, single PCM, cascaded PCM and the proposed multi-layered solid-PCM (MLSPCM) configurations. The analysis shows that the multi-layered solid-PCM concept is a promising alternative for thermal storage in CSP plants. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

Nowadays, energy efficiency is of major concern when using large computing systems such as cluster, grid, and cloud computing facilities. In the approach proposed in this article, a combination of higher-level (i.e., between distributed systems) and lower-level (i.e., within each data-center) schedulers are studied for finding efficient mappings of workflows into the resources in order to maximize the quality of service, while reducing the energy required to compute them. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that accurate schedules are computed by using combined list scheduling heuristics (accounting for both problem objectives) in the higher level, and ad-hoc scheduling techniques to take advantage of multicore infrastructures in the lower level. Solutions are also evaluated with two user- and administrator-oriented metrics. Significant improvements are reported on the two problem objectives when compared with traditional load-balancing and round-robin techniques. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Petch (anamorph F. graminearum Schwabe) is the primary causal agent of FHB of wheat in Uruguay. In the last decade, F. graminearum has produced destructive epidemics on wheat in Uruguay, causing yield losses and price discounts due to reduced seed quality. Strains of F. graminearum clade usually express one of three strain-specific profiles of trichothecene metabolites: nivalenol and its acetylated derivatives (NIV chemotype), deoxynivalenol and 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-AcDON chemotype), or deoxynivalenol and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-AcDON chemotype). A multiplex PCR assay of Tri3, Tri5, and Tri7 was used to determine the trichothecene genotype of 111 strains of F. graminearum collected during 2003 and 2009 growing seasons from fields located in the major wheat production area of Uruguay. The result showed that all except one of the isolates were of DON genotype, with the remainder of NIV genotype in years 2003 and 2009. All strains with the DON genotype were also of the 15-AcDON genotype in 2003 and nearly all (45/50) in 2009. No DON/3-AcDON genotypes were found in either growing season. No potential shifts in the populations were found in the trichothecene genotypes between 2003 and the 2009 epidemic FHB harvest seasons.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for state-feedback exponential stabilizability, in this class of switched systems, are presented. It is shown that, a switched positive linear system is state-feedback exponentially stabilizable if and only if an associated sequence, whose elements are computable via linear programming, has an element smaller than one. Also, a switched positive linear system is state-feedback exponentially stabilizable if and only if there exits a product of their modes matrices whose spectral radius is smaller than one. Equivalently, the state-feedback exponential stabilizability of a switched positive linear system is shown to be equivalent to the solvability of an associated dynamic programming equation on a given convex cone. That associated dynamic programming equation it is shown to have at most one solution. This unique solution, of the associated dynamic programming equation, is shown to be concave, monotonic, positively homogeneous, and the optimal cost functional of a related optimal control problem (involving the switched positive linear system) whose complete solution is also presented in this communication. © 2011 AACC American Automatic Control Council."

Ponce 1306, 11300 Montevideo, Uruguay","The design of vertical formwork is governed by the lateral pressure exerted by fresh concrete; the complexity of the problem is due to the large number of factors which affect pressure. This work describes an experimental investigation in columns to determine the variation in lateral pressure and initial rate of pressure drop with the following variables: formwork size and shape, coarse aggregate concentration and concrete temperature. An 8-run factorial design 2 3 was done to determine the influence of formwork size and shape and coarse aggregate concentration. It was impossible to vary temperature between two levels in the field, so in this analysis this factor was considered as a co-variable. With this objective, square and circular experimental columns 3 m high but with different cross sections were instrumented, and two concrete mixtures with different sand to total aggregate ratios were used. Afterwards, two tests were done to determine the influence in pressure of concrete impact, changing the method for filling the columns. Formwork shape, coarse aggregate concentration and concrete impact have a minor effect in maximum lateral pressure, while temperature shows an inverse relationship with the pressure, but not to a sufficient degree to be considered a significant parameter. On the other hand, formwork size has a major effect on the pressure, narrow sections generate less lateral pressure than higher ones. This is attributed to the friction forces between concrete and formwork which are much more important in small sections. Formwork shape and size present a major influence in the initial rate of pressure decay. While circular formworks present a higher value than squares ones, smaller cross sections present a lower value than larger ones. On the other hand, coarse aggregate concentration has a minor effect on this parameter. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Lead iodide from different suppliers and synthesized from lead nitrate and potassium iodide was purified by zone refining, by zone refining followed by sublimation, by repeated sublimation and by repeated evaporation under different conditions. Purification methods were evaluated by studying parameters of the purified material like decomposition, stoichiometry, purity, and polytype composition, and also taking into account purification yield and rate. Stoichiometry was measured by wet procedures, purity by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and polytypes by powder X-ray diffraction. Sublimation and evaporation give the best stoichiometry (PbI1.90), especially when compared with zone refining (PbI1.40). Purification by 100 zone refining passes gives similar impurity concentration to purification by three evaporations. Furthermore, evaporation exhibits maximum yield and rate (16%/day). Therefore, the work performed indicates that evaporation in Ar atmosphere is the quickest and most efficient purification method for producing spectrometric grade lead iodide, avoiding material decomposition and achieving high purity, maintaining the best stoichiometry."

Catalytic properties of this new surface were studied on the basis of oxygen electroreduction as a model. Kinetic runs were performed with rotating ring-disk electrodes on bare and tin-modified platinum surfaces. Molecular oxygen reduction on tin-modified platinum takes place through the production of both water and hydrogen peroxide. This interpretation was confirmed by calculating the reaction order with respect to oxygen."

The device is essentially a Mach-Zehnder interferometer in which the polarization of light travelling through one arm is orthogonal to the polarization of light travelling through the other arm. At the interferometer output we place a quarter-wave plate with its fast axis at 45° with respect to the polarization directions and a polarizer. By rotating the polarizer, the interfering waves acquire an extra phase (of topological origin) to that expected from the calculations of optical path lengths, and thus, arbitrary phase shifts can be induced. Then, from a set of interferograms recorded while the reference phase is changed, the 'dynamical' phase difference (e.g. the phase profile of an object placed in one of the interferometer arms) can be reconstructed by using techniques of phase-shifting interferometry. © 1998 IOP Publishing Ltd."

In general, the mean climate of H S is modeled empirically or by log-normal or two-parameter Weibull distributions using all available data. Extremal climate studies are conducted separately, usually by means of the peaks-over-threshold (POT) method. The methods used to define the threshold tend to be subjective and generally do not allow for calculation of the associated uncertainty.This paper proposes to use a mixture model for the marginal distribution of H S that includes thresholds between the central regime and minimum and maximum regimes as parameters of the model. The parameters of the model are estimated by maximum likelihood, for which specific recommendations are given. The distribution is able to parametrically model the mean climate of the variable. For calculating extreme values, a simple methodology is described that accounts for the uncertainty stemming from the estimation of the threshold.The implementation of this model using two H S series shows that it provides a better fit for the data than that obtained with parametric distributions such as log-normal or Weibull. Furthermore, this model automatically and objectively determines the threshold necessary to apply the POT method and the uncertainty associated with the threshold. It was observed that the proposed method for the estimation of the threshold is less sensitive to the presence of a potential outliers than other analyzed methods. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."

According to the Rayleigh criterion, the focal spot width is directly related to the wavelength and therefore depends on the mechanical properties of the medium. Thus, the general idea of this work is to extract quantitative estimations of these mechanical properties using a time-reversal approach based on cross-correlations of the wave field. An external source creates mechanical waves in the audible frequency range. One component of the vectorial field is measured along a line as function of time with signal processing developed in the field of 1-D elastography. The shear wavelength information is deduced from these mechanical waves using spatiotemporal correlations and interpreted in the frame of the time-reversal symmetry. The impact of wave attenuation in soft solids is reduced using a spatial average of the correlation field. The result is shown to be suitable for global elasticity estimation. The advantage is that the technique is almost independent of the source kind, shape, and time excitation function. This robustness as regard to shear wave source allows translation of this technique to applications in the medical field, including deep or moving organs. © 2009 IEEE."

Methods: Six pathological scars from five patients were examined by a 20 MHz B-Scanner and compared with healthy skin of the same region. Densitometry analysis was performed with the aid of a dedicated software. Results: All the pathologic scars studied showed an easily identified echo-poor image clearly demarcated from the surrounding not involved tissue. When they were analyzed by densitometry, the lesions had highly significant reduced densitometric values (7.6 ± 4.7) compared with regional healthy skin (31.79 ± 10.8). Conclusion: The high-frequency ultrasonography is a suitable objective and non-invasive method for discriminating healthy from pathologic skin in hypertrophic scars and keloids.

We find synchronization and generalized synchronization of the spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics. The two kinds of synchronization can coexist simultaneously in different regions of the space, and they are mediated by localized structures. A quantitative characterization of the degree of synchronization is given in terms of mutual information measures."

Although the dimension of the attractors generally increases with the delay time, i.e., for short external cavities the attractor is a fixed point or a limit cycle, while for longer external cavities the attractor is a complicated torus or a chaotic attractor, special behavior is found when the external cavity length is chosen such that the product of the delay time T with the relaxation oscillation frequency of the laser frsol yields a number close to integer. For these values of the time delay, the attractors become topologically simpler, i.e., in the regions where the attractor is a limit cycle, for τfrsol ≈ n it becomes a fixed point, in the regions where is a two-torus, it becomes a limit cycle. Also, Lyapunov analysis indicates that in the resonance regions, the stability of the attractors changes strongly. The effects of the resonances are strong for short external cavities but become difficult to detect as the delay time increases."

First the movement inside the two layers is obtained. Next the mass transport of spatially decaying waves is calculated by solving the momentum and mass conservation equations in the Lagrangian coordinate system. Two different physical situations are analysed: the first is waves in a closed channel and the second is waves in an unbounded domain, where the steady-state mass flux may be non-zero. The influence of the viscous properties of the lower layer on the mass transport in both layers is studied. Comparison with the experiments of Sakakiyama & Bijker (1989) in a water-mud system shows good agreement. The results show that the mass transport velocity can be quite different from the velocity given by the rigid bed theory, depending on the physical properties of the lower layer. © 1995, Cambridge University Press.

Janiga, G., University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany","With the increased availability of computational resources, the past decade has seen a rise in the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for medical applications. There has been an increase in the application of CFD to attempt to predict the rupture of intracranial aneurysms, however, while many hemodynamic parameters can be obtained from these computations, to date, no consistent methodology for the prediction of the rupture has been identified. One particular challenge to CFD is that many factors contribute to its accuracy; the mesh resolution and spatial/temporal discretization can alone contribute to a variation in accuracy. This failure to identify the importance of these factors and identify a methodology for the prediction of ruptures has limited the acceptance of CFD among physicians for rupture prediction. The International CFD Rupture Challenge 2013 seeks to comment on the sensitivity of these various CFD assumptions to predict the rupture by undertaking a comparison of the rupture and blood-flow predictions from a wide range of independent participants utilizing a range of CFD approaches. Twenty-six groups from 15 countries took part in the challenge. Participants were provided with surface models of two intracranial aneurysms and asked to carry out the corresponding hemodynamics simulations, free to choose their own mesh, solver, and temporal discretization. They were requested to submit velocity and pressure predictions along the centerline and on specified planes. The first phase of the challenge, described in a separate paper, was aimed at predicting which of the two aneurysms had previously ruptured and where the rupture site was located. The second phase, described in this paper, aims to assess the variability of the solutions and the sensitivity to the modeling assumptions. Participants were free to choose boundary conditions in the first phase, whereas they were prescribed in the second phase but all other CFD modeling parameters were not prescribed. In order to compare the computational results of one representative group with experimental results, steady-flow measurements using particle image velocimetry (PIV) were carried out in a silicone model of one of the provided aneurysms. Approximately 80% of the participating groups generated similar results. Both velocity and pressure computations were in good agreement with each other for cycle-averaged and peaksystolic predictions. Most apparent ""outliers"" (results that stand out of the collective) were observed to have underestimated velocity levels compared to the majority of solutions, but nevertheless identified comparable flow structures. In only two cases, the results deviate by over 35% from the mean solution of all the participants. Results of steady CFD simulations of the representative group and PIV experiments were in good agreement. The study demonstrated that while a range of numerical schemes, mesh resolution, and solvers was used, similar flow predictions were observed in the majority of cases. To further validate the computational results, it is suggested that time-dependent measurements should be conducted in the future. However, it is recognized that this study does not include the biological aspects of the aneurysm, which needs to be considered to be able to more precisely identify the specific rupture risk of an intracranial aneurysm. © 2015 by ASME."

The pH of the alkalis used as catalytic agents in the hydrolysis step is shown to have a strong effect on the structural and morphological properties of the deposited ZnO. The size of the particles was observed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), while Focused Ion Beam-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), were used to analyze the morphology of the films. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra provided evidence of crystal growth together with an increase in the crystalline degree of the hexagonal wurtzite structure after annealing. The bandgap energy was estimated by Tauc's method and found to decrease after annealing, which is attributed to an increase in the crystallite size and to the presence of less defect sites. A good correlation between crystallite size and absorption edges was found. The photoluminescence spectra of as-deposited samples depend on the nature and pH values of catalytic agent used, and reveal the presence of a broad visible emission attributed to a variety of intrinsic defects. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Particularly, the quantitation of glycosylated aroma compounds could be a useful index for winemakers. In the present work, we evaluated the bound compounds profile on Tannat grapes, and the potential of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy coupled to chemometric techniques to determine the concentration of the different glycosylated aroma compounds present in this grape variety. The results showed phenols and norisoprenoids as the quantitative most important group of compounds, representing almost 80 % of the total glycosidic components present in Tannat grapes. The glycosidic form of ethyl-β-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-propionate was identified for the first time in grapes. The results suggested NIR technique as a screening tool for a fast analysis of the grape aroma potential. The application of such methodology would be ideal for fast grape screening purposes, contributing to the winemaking decisions, classification of the fruit, and perhaps maturity monitoring. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

In solution, these peptides tend to aggregate as amorphous clusters of more than 1000 nm, while the presence of DNA promotes their architectonic reorganization as mechanically stable nanometric spherical entities of approximately 80 nm that penetrate mammalian cells through arginine-glycine-aspartic acid cell-binding domains and promote significant transgene expression levels. Results & Conclusion: The structural analysis of the protein in these hybrid nanoparticles indicates a molecular conformation with predominance of α-helix and the absence of cross-molecular, β-sheet-supported protein interactions. The nanoscale organizing forces generated by DNA-protein interactions can then be observed as a potentially tunable, critical factor in the design of protein-only based artificial viruses for gene therapy. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd."

This is akin to the problem of analytic continuation in complex variable. Analytic continuation is the extension of an analytic function in a limited domain to a larger domain. The general continuation problem involving acoustic sources enclosed by a surface is first analyzed. It is shown that a unique continuation to the far field is possible provided either the pressure or the pressure gradient normal to the surface is given on the surface. The continuation can be carried out by means of a surface Green's function. In the case of high-speed jets, a suitable bounding surface is a conical surface enclosing the jet. However, except for very simple bounding surfaces, surface Green's function for every source point on the surface may require extensive effort to determine or to compute. In this paper, an adjoint Green's function is used. One significant advantage of using adjoint Green's function is that for a given direction of radiation, one is required to solve only a single acoustic scattering problem. For problems involving a broadband time-stationary sound field such as the noise field of a high-speed jet, it is shown that the two-point space-time pressure correlation function on the bounding surface is the equivalent noise source. By using a conical surface placed sufficiently close to the jet flow, it is believed that the noise source characteristics are imprinted on the two-point space-time pressure correlation function. Thus it becomes possible to study the noise source location, intensity, frequency distribution and other characteristics by using near field measurements. Validation tests for the present method are provided. For this purpose, simple problems with analytical or computational solutions are employed. Both time periodic and broadband time-stationary sources are included. Because the present method requires measuring only the fluctuation pressure on the bounding surface whereas other popular methods such as the Kirchhoff integral method or the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings equation requires measuring three or more variables, it appears that the present method has definite advantage when it is used to extend an experimentally measured near acoustic field to the far field. © 2010 by CKW Tam."

The presence of Stone-Wales (SW) defect sites significantly increases the reactivity of SWCNTs against the thiol group. The most reactive site for the addition of the SH radical is the single vacancy defect; the sulfur atom reconstructs the SWCNT framework and the hydrogen atom becomes attached to a carbon atom. The cluster model calculations performed for perfect SWCNTs confirmed a very low reactivity with the thiol group, even for the small diameter and metallic SWCNTs. The reaction between the perfect SWCNT and SH results thermodynamically unfavorable. The different reactivities observed for perfect and defective SWCNTs suggest that the SH group can be employed to perform a chemical labeling of the defect sites present in carbon nanotubes. The SH radical group is quite unique because, even though it has an unpaired electron, it does not react with sp2 carbon frameworks, unless they have defects or curvature similar to C60. The results are discussed in terms of the recent experimental investigations about thiolated SWCNTs. We were able to explain the Transmission Electron Microscopy images of thiolated nanotubes and the lack of reactivity at the tips. Finally, we discuss a possible route to synthesize sulfur-doped SWCNTs using thiol groups and their electronic properties. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

In order to investigate such effects, a series of molecular precursors was investigated, consisting of three substituted ferrocenes with a lateral C-C group fully saturated (ethylferrocene) or with a single (vinylferrocene) or double unsaturation (ethynylferrocene). The corresponding functionalized Si(100) wafers were produced following new or literature recipes, starting from hydrogenated Si surfaces. The relationship between the degree of unsaturation in the anchored arm of each adduct and its electronic structure and electrochemical behaviour was investigated by comparing experimental (XPS, electrochemical) and ab initio results of the redox potentials in the series. Density functional theory (DFT) was applied, with inclusion of solute-solvent interactions. Different bond arrangements of the C-C arm with Si surface dimer atoms have been produced theoretically within the series of ferrocenes. Distinct values of redox potentials were displayed by the hybrids, which can be consistently related to the structural differences presented. In fact, measured and computed potentials showed a very satisfactory match only for specific adduct isomers, providing strong indications that the carbon-carbon unsaturation initially present in the anchoring arm is preserved upon addition reaction, an unprecedented result. The demonstrated tunability of a well-defined switching potential in these molecules on silicon can be beneficial to the development of Si-based memory devices. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We aim to depict the relationship between river outflow and variability of fronts' loci on monthly to ENSO-related timescales and the influence of the winds along Rio de la Plata (axial winds) on the abrupt changes in frontal dynamics over synoptic timescales. During the studied period both La Niña (July 1999-June 2000) and El Niño (April 2002-May 2003) events induced significant displacements of fronts. Three distinct fronts were analyzed between river, estuarine, coastal and marine waters of the Rio de la Plata: Main Turbidity Front, Main Marine Front, and Secondary Marine Front. Their number, location and separation seem to be mainly related to river outflow and second, to fresh (>8 m/s) axial winds. During low discharge periods (i.e. summer time and/or La Niña events) these winds induce abrupt changes in the location of fronts (100-200 km) and greater separation between them over synoptic timescale, whereas during high river discharge or ENSO years some of the variability of fronts location is explained by the river's outflow fluctuations, especially by the high variability of the River Uruguay discharge. © 2008."

We derive analytically the Fisher information matrix under this framework and obtain the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the variance of an estimator of the traffic matrix. Applications for the use of the CRLB are then demonstrated. From the bounds we can directly obtain confidence intervals for maximum likelihood estimates. Another use for the CRLB is the possibility to evaluate the efficiency of an estimator against the lower bound. A third possible application is to utilize the bounds in an approach to find the best placement for direct measurements of OD flows, so that it is optimal with regard to the traffic matrix estimation problem. © 2006 IEEE."

It is assumed that the temperature in a point of the medium is non-linearly related to some spectral features and one temporal feature, extracted from the collected RF-lines. The black-box models used are radial basis functions neural networks (RBFNNs), where the best-fitted models were selected from the space of model structures using a genetic multi-objective strategy. The best-fitted predictive model presents a maximum absolute error less than 0.4°C in a prediction horizon of approximately 2 h, in an unseen data sequence.

One of these anomalies (at 350 K for SBN and 323 K for PBN) was associated with a second-order phase transition, confirming the ferroelectric orthorhombic-ferroelectric tetragonal phase transition suggested for both systems in this temperature range."

Brain Res.80, 75-85 (1989); Muscle Afferents and Spinal Control of Movement (1992)] using an ultrasound transit-time (USTT) technique. This method assumed that the velocity of ultrasound through intact muscles was constant, independent of fiber orientation, muscle activity, load, belly shape, or fiber movement. However, the velocity of ultrasound along and across the fibers has been reported to depend on the state of muscle activation in frog muscle experiments in vitro [Hatta et al., J. Physiol.403, 193-209 (1988)]. In the present study, the assumption of constant velocity of ultrasound in the cat MG muscle was evaluated. In acute experiments, done in situ with intact blood supply, the USTT was measured along and across cat MG muscle fibers in the passive, reflexly activated and tetanically activated states, with and without changes in muscle fiber length, for situations that reproduced the length and force ranges normally used by cats during locomotion. The velocity of ultrasound was found to be independent of the state of activation or motion of the muscle, and independent of the direction of the measurement with respect to the fiber orientation, within a measurement uncertainty ≤0.2%. These results validate the use of the USTT technique for the measurement of intramuscular dimensions in freely moving animals. © 1992."

The inclusion of polycations in the interlamellar space led to modifications in the properties of the clay. An eleven fold increase in specific surface area with respect to the calcined starting clay was found for the Al-C, whereas a twofold increase was observed for the Cr-C; the value for the Al-Cr-C was only slightly higher than that for the latter. Diffractograms of the Cr-C showed the occurrence of a Cr2O3 phase.

This part reports the results of a systematic experimental study of the near acoustic field of a high-speed jet. The aim is to shed light on the noise source characteristics of the jet. A microphone array consisting of twenty-one semicircular rings of microphones is built for the experiment. The microphone array extends from one diameter from the nozzle exit to a distance of thirty-one diameters downstream. The microphones lie on a conical surface of ten degrees half-apex angle surrounding the jet. Two-point space-time pressure correlations are measured. There are two principal objectives in this study. The first objective is to validate the near field to far field continuation method, developed in the Part I paper, with experimental data. For this purpose, two series of validation tests are performed. First is a comparison of far field noise spectra between those continued from near field measurements on the conical surface and those measured directly in the far field. Another test series consists of comparisons of far field directivities at selected Strouhal numbers, again, between those continued from the near field measurements to the far field and those measured directly in the far field. Favorable agreements are found. These tests not only validate the continuation method developed in the Part I paper but also support the recognition that the two-point space-time pressure correlation function on the conical surface is the equivalent source of jet noise. This realization offers a way to investigate the characteristics of jet noise sources by analyzing those of the equivalent noise sources. The second objective of this experimental study is to investigate the noise source location, strength, size, convection speed, degree of randomness and other characteristics along the length of the jet. The noise source can also be decomposed into azimuthal modes. It will be shown that the axisymmetric noise source mode is the most dominant. Contributions to the radiated noise from modes higher than the second mode are negligible. Other modal characteristics such as propagation speed, location of maximum intensity and others will be reported. Finally, strong evidence will be presented to show the wave-like nature of the source of high-speed jet noise. © 2010 by CKW Tam."

In several cases, these tags must be removed before performing functional and structural studies. The enzyme most frequently used to cleave tags of recombinant proteins is the TEV-protease (tobacco-etch-virus NIa protease). The continuous production of this enzyme in soluble form is quite an expensive process and not easily accessible to many laboratories. Thus an interesting alternative is the use of TEV-protease in an immobilized form, which may be reutilized several times. The main objective of the present study was to obtain a TEV-protease in an immobilized form, by covalent immobilization on to solid supports through selective use of different amino acid residues, lysine or cysteine. High protein immobilization yields (75-97 %) were obtained with both strategies. The TEV-protease immobilized through its exposed cysteine thiol groups maintained its ability for cleaving a 20 kDa substrate. While the activity of the immobilized TEV-protease maintained only 30% of the activity of the enzyme in soluble form, its stability at 4 °C was improved three times. Moreover, this enzyme could be reutilized in at least five cycles of cleavage without loss of performance. The present results indicate that the use of a TEV-protease in an immobilized form is a potentially useful tool for the cleavage of His tags of recombinant proteins and may be useful for reducing the cost of the total process of cleavage. © 2009 Portland Press Ltd."

Detection of 53 pM target within a 2000× excess of non-complementary sequences was possible.

Growth was performed several times and results were reproducible. Crystals have rectangular or hexagonal (0 0 1) faces, sizes up to 4×6 mm2 and thickness from 50 to 250 μm, an exceptional good optical clarity and reflecting surfaces. Purity and stoichiometry of starting materials were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma and wet techniques. Platelets were characterized by optical microscopy. Radiation detectors were fabricated with them and detector current density and apparent resistivity were determined by I-V curves, giving results 300 pA/cm2 (30 V) and 1013 Ω.cm.

The spectral resolving elements are a pair of cryogenic, scanning Fabry-Perot interferometers which use a free- standard Ni mesh for the etalon mirrors. The detectors for SPIFI are a 5 X 5 array of bolometers coupled to the focal plane with Winston cones. An adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator cools the bolometers to approximately 60 mK while a 3He system operates simultaneously as a thermal guard. SPIFI is intended to operate on the ASO/RO submillimeter telescope at the South Pole and on the JCMT telescope on Mauna Kea and will be used to study the gas- phase reservoirs of carbon in star-forming regions in our own and near-by galaxies. SPIFI takes advantage of three things: (1) Advanced bolometers that achieve background limited performance at very high resolving powers. (2) The imaging capability and high spectral resolving power of Fabry-Perot interferometers. (3) The superb atmospheric transmission in submillimeter bands possible from the South Pole. The SPIFI uses state-of-the-art monolithic silicon bolometers fabricated at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The cryogenic, scanning Fabry-Perots in SPIFI were designed and built at Cornell and are an evolution of the design used with great success for the Kuiper Wide Field Camera.

It is well known that the nonlinear gain tends to stabilize the dynamics, while the optical feedback tends to increase the instabilities. In this paper, we study the behavior of the attractors when the feedback level κ and the gain saturation coefficient ε vary and show that the effects of these parameters are surprisingly opposite. For example, we find that the route to chaos that the external cavity modes follow for increasing κ is reversed for increasing ε in an almost identical manner. When the feedback increases the modes follow the usual quasi-periodic route and turn into torus. If κ continues to increase, the torus become chaotic attractors as the result of several period-doubling bifurcations or a third Hopf bifurcation. Further increase of κ causes the chaotic attractors to lose stability, Contrarily, if the value of the parameter ε is increased, the attractors recover their stability and reverse the route becoming simple torus again. If ε is increased further, the torus reverse the quasi-periodic route and turn into stable modes again. We also find that on the contrary to κ, the parameter ε enhances the stability region of an attractor. We show that the feedback level above which a limit cycle emerges from a stable mode, the feedback level above which a torus emerges from a limit cycle, and the feedback level above which a chaotic attractor loses stability are all increasing functions of ε."

The chloromethyl-styrene latex (CMS) was synthesized by means of a core-shell emulsion polymerization in a batch reactor. The monodisperse-obtained latex was characterized by determining the diameter (TEM and PCS), the surface charge density (conductometric and potentiometric titration), the amount of chloromethyl groups on the surface (hydrolysis reaction), and the stability vs electrolyte concentration (turbidity measurements). Electrokinetic characterization was also performed (electrophoretic mobility versus pH and ionic strength). IgG was chemically bound to the latex particles under different sensitization and block-stabilization conditions. Colloidal stability of complexes was studied to select an immunolatex suitable for the development of latex immunoassays. The final part of this work consists of a study of the immunoreactivity of the IgG-latex complexes at different pH and ionic strength, in particular under physiological conditions.

In spite of its superior properties in the hardened state, HPC suffers from many practical difficulties such as its sensitivity to early-age cracking (which is associated with self-desiccation and autogenous shrinkage). In this context, conventional curing procedures are not sufficiently effective to address these limitations. In order to overcome this issue, two strategies, which are based on the use of internal reservoirs of water, have been recently developed. One of these strategies is based on the use of lightweight aggregates (LWA), while the other is based on the use of superabsorbent polymers (SAP). This paper studies and compares the efficiency of the LWA and SAP approaches. Moreover, some of the theoretical aspects that should be taken into account to optimize their application for internal curing of HPC are also discussed. Two fine LWA’s and one SAP are studied in terms of autogenous deformation and compressive strength. Increasing the amounts of LWA or SAP can lead to a reduction of the autogenous deformation and compressive strength (especially when adding large amounts). By selecting appropriate materials and controlling their amount, size, and porosity, highly efficient internal water curing can be ensured. © 2014, The Author(s)."

The Cu2O was potentiostatically grown at a potential value of -0.450V (vs. SMSE) at 70°C. The Cu2O thin films were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), optical transmission, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and photoelectrochemical experiments. Through these techniques, it was possible to establish the cubic Cu2O phase with a high crystallinity and a strong preferential growth along the [200] and [220] directions. Cu2O thin films show oxygen vacancies with formation of a nonstoichiometric compound with the presence of Cu(0) in the crystal lattice as determined by XPS analysis. In addition, Cu2O was used as the photoanode for the I- oxidation reaction when the system was illuminated (Φ0=50. 0mWcm-2). The films exhibited a clear n-type semiconductor behavior, which was in agreement with the Mott-Schottky results. This behavior was explained by considering the nonstoichiometry of the oxide.

This paper studies the slower dynamics of connections themselves, that arrive randomly in the network and are served at the allocated rate. It has been shown that under the condition that the mean offered load at each link is less than its capacity, the resulting queueing system is stochastically stable, for the case of exponentially distributed file-sizes. The conjecture that the result holds for general file-size distributions has remained open, and is very relevant since heavy-tailed distributions are often the best models of Internet file sizes. In this paper, building on existing fluid models of the system, we use a partial differential equation to characterize the dynamics. The equation keeps track of residual file size and therefore is suitable for general file size distributions. For alpha fair bandwidth allocation, with any positive alpha parameter, a Lyapunov function is constructed with negative drift when the offered load is less than capacity. With this tool we answer the conjecture affirmatively in the fluid sense: we prove asymptotic convergence to zero of the fluid model for general file-size distributions of finite mean, and finite-time convergence for those of finite p>1 moment. In the stochastic sense, we build on recent work that relates fluid and stochastic stability subject to a certain light-tailed restriction. We further provide the supplementary fluid stability argument to establish the conjecture for this class that includes phase-type distributions. Results are supplemented by illustrative network simulations at the packet level. © 2011 IEEE."

In these systems the analyte is detected when it competes for binding to the detecting antibody with a tracer compound. In this work we introduce the use of phage particles bearing peptides that mimic the target analyte as surrogates for conventional tracers. As a proof of concept, we developed a magneto-electrochemical immunosensor (EI) for the herbicide molinate and compare its performance with conventional formats. Using the same anti-molinate antibody and phage particles bearing a molinate peptidomimetic, the EI performed with an IC 50 of 0.15ngmL -1 (linear range from 4.4×10 -3 to 10ngmL -1). Compared to the conventional ELISA, the EI was faster (minutes), performed with a much wider linear range, and the detection limit that was 2500-fold lower. The EI produced consistent measurements and could be successfully used to assay river water samples with excellent recoveries. By using the same EI with a conventional tracer, we found that an important contribution to the gain in sensitivity is due to the filamentous structure of the phage (9×1000nm) which works as a multienzymatic tracer, amplifying the competitive reaction. Since phage-borne peptidomimetics can be selected from phage display libraries in a straightforward systematic manner and their production is simple and inexpensive, they can contribute to facilitate the development of ultrasensitive biosensors. © 2011 Elsevier B.V."

It was found that the effect of CA is due to direct interaction with the precipitating protein. Maximum precipitation was achieved when the mass ratio of CA-BSA was close to 1, equivalent to about 450 CA molecules per molecule of BSA. This value was confirmed by optimizing the CA purification of immunoglobulins from equine blood plasma. With a sample diluted 1:1, it was found that CA at a final concentration of 3.5% is optimal to obtain immunoglobulins essentially free of albumin by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It is proposed that CA binds to specific sites of the protein, thereby inducing partial unfolding of the protein, which exposes additional binding sites. More CA molecules incorporate into all sites in the form of mixed micelles. Thus, the interfacial protein surface becomes highly hydrophobic and increases protein-protein attraction, causing association and precipitation of the macromolecular complexes.

Aims: To analyze (a) the carotid-radial PWV temporal profile during flow mediated dilatation test, and (b) the PWV changes considering its main vascular geometrical (diameter) and intrinsic (elastic modulus) determinants. Methods: Sixteen healthy young adults were included. The carotid-radial PWV (strain gauge mechano-transducers), wall thickness and brachial diameter (B-Mode ultrasound) were measured before (basal state), during a forearm cuff inflation (5 minutes) and after its deflation (10 minutes). The PWV, brachial diameter and elastic modulus changes and temporal profile were analyzed (basal state, 15, 30, 45, and 60 seconds after cuff deflation). Results: Transient ischaemia was associated with arterial stiffness changes, evidenced by carotid-radial PWV variations. The PWV and diastolic diameter changes, and temporal profiles differed. The arterial stiffness changes could not be explained only by geometrical (diameter) changes.

We impose the following conditions: fully distributed solutions over an arbitrary network topology, and the requirement that resources allocated in a given auction are reserved for the entire duration of the connection, not subject to future contention. Under these conditions, we study the problem of selling capacity to optimize revenue for the operator. We first study optimal revenue for a single distributed auction in a general network. Next, the periodic auctions case is considered for a single link, modelling the optimal revenue problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP); we develop a sequence of receding horizon approximations to its solution. Combining the two approaches we formulate a receding horizon optimization of revenue over a general network topology, that yields a distributed implementation. The proposal is demonstrated through simulations. © 2009 IEEE."

The proposed experimental methodology determines the flow conditions for a given equilibrium scour instead of determining the equilibrium scour for given flow conditions, which is the usual practice. The basic hypothesis is that the shape of the scour hole is essentially related to the scour depth and sediment properties, but not to flow conditions. This hypothesis is checked experimentally. The proposed methodology may drastically reduce the time period required for experiments (from weeks to hours), and avoids the uncertainties due to the equilibrium scour being usually achieved asymptotically. Some preliminary results of the equilibrium scour obtained with the proposed methodology are compared to the expressions given in the literature, showing fair agreement. © 2008 ASCE."

The main difficulty with such a system is the high dynamics of the P2P topology, because of the frequent moves of the nodes leaving and entering the network. We consider a multi-source approach where the stream is decomposed into several flows sent by different peers to each client. Using the recently proposed PSQA technology for evaluating automatically and accurately the perceived quality at the client side, the paper focuses on the consequences of the way the stream is decomposed on the resulting quality. Our main contribution is to provide a global methodology that can be used to design such a system, illustrated by looking at three extreme cases. Our approach allows to do the design by addressing the ultimate target, the perceived quality (or Quality of Experience), instead of the standard but indirect metrics such as loss rates, delays, reliability, etc. We also propose an improved version of PSQA obtained by considering the video sequences at frame-level, instead of the packet-level approach of previous works. © 2007 IEEE."

Two different expansions of have led to two different sets of Lang and Kobayashi equations; in the first set, the intensity reduction of the optical gain G is taken into account in the linearization of ω, while in the second set it is neglected. Although in the literature the investigations of semiconductor lasers with optical feedback have been based on either of these sets, they are equal only when a linear form for G is assumed. In this paper, it is shown that on which set of Lang and Kobayashi equations the investigatioas are based is an important fact to take into account when interpreting the results, since it is shown that if the nonlinear gain is considered, the dynamics predicted by the two sets are very different. In particular, it is shown that behavior of the external cavity modes and the stability properties of the attractors differ greatly when the gain saturation coefficient ε is varied."

In this paper, we: 1) review the perspectives of such devices for low-power high-frequency analog integrated circuit applications (e.g., GHz operation with sub-0.1 mW power consumption); 2) discuss and employ a compact TFET device model in the context of the $g-{m}/I-{d integrated analog circuit design methodology; and 3) compare several proposed TFET technologies for such applications. The advantages of TFETs arise since these devices can operate in the sub-threshold region with larger transconductance-to-current ratio than traditional FETs, which is due to the current turn-on mechanism being interband tunneling rather than thermionic emission. Starting from technology computer-aided design and/or analytical models for Si-FinFETs, graphene nano-ribbon (GNR) TFETs and InAs/GaSb TFETs at the 15-nm gate-length node, as well as InAs double-gate TFETs at the 20-nm gate-length node, we conclude that GNR TFETs might promise larger bandwidths at low-voltage drives due to their high current densities in the sub-threshold region.

In a network where links may fail, the connectedness probability is called all-terminal reliability. The model is suitable for FTTH services, where link failures are unpredictable. In real scenarios, terminals must be connected by a limited number of hops. Therefore, we study the Diameter-Constrained Reliability (DCR). We are given a simple graph G=(V,E), a subset K⊆V of terminals, a diameter d and independent failure probabilities q=1-p for each link. The goal is to find the probability RK,Gd that all terminals remain connected by paths composed by d hops or less. The general DCR computation is NP-Hard, and the target probability is a polynomial in p. In this paper we study the DCR metric. It connects reliability with quality, and should be considered in the design of the physical layer in FTTH services together with connectivity requirements. We include a full discussion of the computational complexity of the DCR as a function of the number of terminals k=|K| and diameter d. Then, we find efficient DCR computation for Monma graphs, an outstanding family of topologies from robust network design. The computation suggests corollaries that enrich the subset of instances that accept efficient DCR computation. Inspired in its NP-Hardness, we introduce two approximation algorithms in order to find the DCR in general. The first one estimates the target polynomial counting special subgraphs. The second finds pointwise estimations of the polynomial using conditioned-Monte Carlo, and applies Newton's interpolation followed by a rounding stage of the coefficients. The performance of both methods is discussed on the lights of Complete, Harary and Monma graphs. In order to study scalability, we analytically find the diameter-constrained reliability of a series-parallel graph with 44 nodes and 72 links. The results suggest that our counting implementation outperforms the interpolation technique, and is scalable as well.

The aim of this paper is to demonstrate, theoretically and practically, the feasibility of developing SCC in the range of medium strength. In this study, cement kiln dust (CKD) was used as a local filler, and six mixtures with different percentages of cement replacement by CKD were investigated. Properties at fresh and hardened state were studied. The use of high percentages of CKD and different combinations of water/fines ratio allows economizing on the use of the admixture and the amount of cement required, obtaining SCC of medium strength and lower production costs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Fresh samples were analysed in a scanning spectrophotometer NIRSystems 6500 in reflectance mode (1100-2500 nm). Principal component analysis (PCA) and stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) were used to classify samples according to the animal species based on their near infrared reflectance (NIR) spectra. Full cross validation was used as validation method when classification models were developed. Both beef and pork paté samples were classified correctly (100%) while binary mixture samples only achieved 72% of correct classification using SLDA technique. The results demonstrated the usefulness of NIR spectra combined with chemometrics as an objective and rapid method to classify paté samples according to meat type.

XRD, SEM, and TEM analysis were employed to characterize structural (crystal phase, crystallographic texture, and grain size), and morphological nanowire properties. It was confirmed that at pH 2 the electrodeposition potential has not influence on the preferred crystallographic orientation of the electrochemically grown Co nanowires. At pH 4 the electrodeposition potential controls the growth of cobalt nanowires along some preferential crystallographic planes. The electrolytic pH bath modulates the fcc or hcp phase exhibited by the cobalt nanowires. Single crystalline nanowires with a hcp phase strongly oriented along the (2021) crystallographic plane were obtained at pH 4 and at-1.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), a result not previously reported. High electrolytic bath temperatures contributed to improve the single crystalline character of the cobalt nanowires. The presence of chloride anion in the electrolytic bath also influenced on the structural properties of the resulting cobalt nanowires, improving their crystallinity. The optical reflectance of the samples shows a structure in the UV-blue region that can be assigned to the two-dimensional morphology arising in the shape of the almost parallel nanowires. Magnetic measurements showed that different electrodeposition potentials and electrolytic bath pH lead to different magnetic anisotropies on the nanowire array samples.

The proposed method is based on the polarization properties of the twisted-nematic liquid-crystal displays (LCDs). LCDs are manufactured to work between a polarizer-analyzer pair, and for a given incident polarization direction, the image contrast will depend on the analyzer orientation. In particular, two analyzer orientations of interest could be identified for the proposed experiments: one that reproduces the image displayed on the LCD, and the other one (orthogonal to the former) that gives a negative (contrast reversed) replica of the original image. By placing a beamsplitter after the LCD, two images are spatially separated, analyzed by linear polarizers in perpendicular directions, and then slightly displaced. When the original image and its displaced (contrast reverted) replica are imagined together across a plane, one obtains a resultant image with enhanced first derivatives along a specific direction. Unlike the usual Fourier (coherent) image processing, the technique proposed here works with incoherent illumination. Validation experiments are presented. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The films developed were characterized in terms of microstructure, composition, and mechanical properties. Crystalline development and a single orientation were obtained at high temperatures, where at the same time an increase in mechanical intrinsic stresses was observed. Well crystallized 0001 films were obtained at temperature as low as 500 °C. Furthermore, the evolution of microstructure with thickness at higher temperatures showed a single 0001 orientation with progressive increase of the texture as the thickness increased. This fact was related with changes in the observed microstructure along the film z-axis, evaluated by high resolution transmission electronic microscopy and selected area electron diffraction. Although orientation dispersion of these films, evidenced by the rocking curves FWHM, remained relatively high (>9°), they can be regarded as promising for piezoelectric applications. Annealing tests conducted at relatively high temperatures with films deposited at low temperature indicated that thermal effects have only a major effect during the film growth for the temperature values employed. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

We first show that, formally, the term-by-document matrix (a mathematical representation of a set of codified documents) can be interpreted as an associative memory. In this framework, the dimensionality reduction of the term-by-document matrices produced by the latent semantic analysis (LSA) has a common factor with the matrix biological memories. This factor consists in the generation of a statistical 'conceptualisation' of data using little dispersed weighted averages. Then, we present a class of matrix memory that built up thematic blocks using multiplicative contexts. The thematic memories define modular networks that can be acceded using contexts as passwords. This mathematical structure emphasises the contacts between LSA and matrix memory models and invites to interpret LSA, and similar procedures, as a reverse engineering applied on context-deprived cognitive products, or on biological objects (e.g. genomes) selected during large evolutionary processes."

Equivalently, a switched linear system is state-feedback exponentially stabilizable if and only if a dynamic programming equation admits a solution of some kind. We also address the issue of testing the stabilizability of a given switched system by computing the elements of a new associated sequence of upper bounds for the elements of the previously mentioned sequence. These computations involve the solution of convex programming problems. The elements of both associated sequences are shown to be related via Lagrange duality.

The sharp increase in the current vs potential slope from ca. 1.1 V obeys the detection of cyanate ions together with p-(methyl)-phenoxide ions. No adsorbed carbon monoxide as well as carbon dioxide was detected by this methodology in the whole studied potential range.

However, due to differences in peptide expression and the heterogeneity of the phage preparations, there is no easy way to compare the binding properties of the selected clones, which operates as a major ""bottleneck"" of the technology. Here, we present the development of a new type of library that allows rapid comparison of the relative affinity of the selected peptides in a high-throughput screening format. As a model system, a phage display peptide library constructed on a phagemid vector that contains the bacterial alkaline phosphatase gene (BAP) was selected with an antiherbicide antibody. Due to the intrinsic switching capacity of the library, the selected peptides were transferred ""en masse"" from the phage coat protein to BAP. This was coupled to an optimized affinity ELISA where normalized amounts of the peptide - BAP fusion allow direct comparison of the binding properties of hundreds of peptide ligands. The system was validated by plasmon surface resonance experiments using synthetic peptides, showing that the method discriminates among the affinities of the peptides within 3 orders of magnitude.

Cyclic voltammetrics have been performed to compare the current vs potential profiles of modified platinum surfaces in acid solution at room temperature. The inhibition of the hydrogen adatom voltammetric profile by foreign metal adatoms on platinum was used to calculate the degree of surface coverage by the metal. Poisoning effects were checked by anodic stripping experiments of methanol residues on the modified platinum surfaces at adsorption potentials in the hydrogen electrosorption region using a micro flux cell. Methanol solution oxidation was also evaluated at slow scan rates of up to 0.8 vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) on the platinum-modified surfaces.

The goal is to compute an expected value E[g(X(τ), τ)] of a given function g depending on the solution X of an Itô stochastic differential equation and on the first exit time τ from a given domain. The adaptive algorithms are based on an extension of an error expansion with computable leading order term, for the approximation of E[g(X(T))] with a fixed final time T &gt; 0 and diffusion processes X in ℝd, introduced in [17] using stochastic flows and dual backward solutions. The main steps in the extension to stopped diffusion processes are to use a conditional probability to estimate the first exit time error and introduce difference quotients to approximate the initial data of the dual solutions. Numerical results show that the adaptive algorithms achieve the time discretization error of order N-1 with N adaptive time steps, while the error is of order N-1/2 for a method with N uniform time steps."

In most cases these grafts fail in-vivo due to the presence of a mechanical mismatch between the native vessel and the vascular graft. Biomechanical characterization of real native vessels provides significant information for synthetic graft development. Electrospun nanofibrous vascular grafts emerge as a potential tailor made solution to this problem. PLLA-electrospun nanofibrous tubular structures were prepared and selected as model bioresorbable grafts. An experimental setup, using gold standard and high resolution ultrasound techniques, was adapted to characterize in vitro the poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) electrospun structures. The grafts were subjected to near physiologic pulsated pressure conditions, following the pressure-diameter loop approach and the criteria stated in the international standard for cardiovascular implants-tubular vascular prostheses. Additionally, ovine femoral arteries were subjected to a similar evaluation. Measurements of pressure and diameter variations allowed the estimation of dynamical compliance (%C, 10- 2 mm Hg) and the pressure-strain elastic modulus (EPε, 106 dyn cm- 2) of the abovementioned vessels (grafts and arteries). Nanofibrous PLLA showed a decrease in %C (1.38 ± 0.21, 0.93 ± 0.13 and 0.76 ± 0.15) concomitant to an increase in EPε (10.57 ± 0.97, 14.31 ± 1.47 and 17.63 ± 2.61) corresponding to pressure ranges of 50 to 90 mm Hg, 80 to 120 mm Hg and 100 to 150 mm Hg, respectively. Furthermore, femoral arteries exhibited a decrease in %C (8.52 ± 1.15 and 0.79 ± 0.20) and an increase in EPε (1.66 ± 0.30 and 15.76 ± 4.78) corresponding to pressure ranges of 50-90 mm Hg (elastin zone) and 100-130 mm Hg (collagen zone). Arterial mechanics framework, extensively applied in our previous works, was successfully used to characterize PLLA vascular grafts in vitro, although its application can be directly extended to in vivo experiences, in conscious and chronically instrumented animals. The specific design and construction of the electrospun nanofibrous PLLA vascular grafts assessed in this work, showed similar mechanical properties as the ones observed in femoral arteries, at the collagen pressure range. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We present how noise on DTV can introduce individual transport stream (TS) packet losses at the receiver. The type of these errors is different than the produced on IP networks. Different scenarios of TS packet loss are analyzed, including uniform and burst distributions. The results show that there is a high variability on the perceived quality for a given percentage of packet loss and type of error. This implies that there is practically no correlation between the type of error or the percentage of packets loss and the perceived degradation. A new metric is introduced, the weighted percentage of slice loss, which takes into account the affected slice type in each lost TS packet. We show that this metric is correlated with the video quality degradation. A novel parametric model for video quality estimation is proposed, designed, and verified based on the results of subjective tests in SD and HD. The results were compared to a standard model used in IP transmission scenarios. The proposed model improves Pearson Correlation and root mean square error between the subjective and the predicted MOS. © 2014 Jose Joskowicz and Rafael Sotelo."

Several techniques and analyses such as value stream mapping (VSM), overall equipment efficiency, spaghetti diagrams, work balance, and discrete event simulation were applied in this case study. Some of the improvement ideas resulting from the tools used were tested in the field to corroborate the findings. Finally, the future state VSM was mapped, where most of the improvement ideas identified throughout the project were consolidated. Whether the path to improvement is marked by increased spending on systems and machinery, human capital, or both, engineers and managers in the frontlines of food production recognize that improvement is a quest and not a destination.

However, there is much interest in developing safer and more environmentally friendly sanitization methods. Watercress was immersed in sodium hypochlorite (100mg/L), hydrogen peroxide (167mg/L) or citric acid (10g/L) or exposed to ultraviolet C (UV-C) light (6 or 18kJ/m2 by exposure for 3 or 7min, respectively), and stored in modified atmosphere packaging at 5C and 95% relative humidity. The respiration rate, packaging gas composition, color, microbiological growth (psychrotrophic and mesophilic microorganisms, Enterobacteriaceae, mold and yeasts), antioxidant capability, polyphenol content and sensory quality were measured. The different treatments did not affect the respiration rate (average 22mg CO2/kg·h) after 14 days. Psychrotrophic bacteria reached approximately 7 log10 cfu/g, regardless of the treatment, after 14 days. UV-C decreased mesophilic counts, while H2O2 reduced Enterobacteriaceae. UV-C exposure increased the antioxidant capability, which was maintained throughout the storage. None of the treatments affected the color parameters and sensory quality. All of the treatments analyzed, especially UV-C, may be useful for maintaining watercress quality. Practical Applications: Increasing popularity of nontraditional vegetables has created a new opportunity for innovation in the development of horticultural minimally processed fresh products. This industry is interested in developing safer and more environmentally friendly sanitization methods to replace chlorine-based washing systems. This study focused on the assessment of immersion in three chemical-sanitizer solutions (sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide and citric acid) or the exposure to ultraviolet C (UV-C) light in combination with modified atmosphere packaging and refrigerated storage (5C and 95% relative humidity). The evaluated disinfection methods resulted as or more effective at reducing microbial growth than chlorine washing. The UV-C treatments improved the functional quality of watercress by increasing the total antioxidant capability and total polyphenol content. The implementation of low cost sanitization methods such as the tested alternative sanitizers or UV-C light may be useful for maintaining the overall quality and extending the shelf life of ready-to-eat watercress and other vegetables. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

It would provide a technical basis to study the options for early diagnosis of some serious diseases such as hypertension, atherosclerosis or tuberculosis. Nevertheless, achieving the aim of non-invasive measurement of those scarcely-accessible parameters on patient internal tissues, currently presents many difficulties. The use of high-frequency ultrasonic transducer systems appears to offer a possible solution. Previous studies using conventional ultrasonic imaging have shown this, but the spatial resolution was not sufficient so as to permit a thickness evaluation with clinical significance, which requires an accuracy of a few microns. In this paper a broadband ultrasonic technique, that was recently developed by the authors to address other non-invasive medical detection problems (by integrating a piezoelectric transducer into a spectral measuring system), is extended to our new objective; the aim is its application to the thickness measurement of sub-millimeter membranes or layers made of materials similar to some biological tissues (phantoms). The modeling and design rules of such a transducer system are described, and various methods of estimating overtones location in the power spectral density (PSD) are quantitatively assessed with transducer signals acquired using piezoelectric systems and also generated from a multi-echo model. Their effects on the potential resolution of the proposed thickness measuring tool, and their capability to provide accuracies around the micron are studied in detail. Comparisons are made with typical tools for extracting spatial parameters in laminar samples from echo-waveforms acquired with ultrasonic transducers. Results of this advanced measurement spectral tool are found to improve the performance of typical cross-correlation methods and provide reliable and high-resolution estimations. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

The implementation of improvements to software practices and processes is a particular case of organizational change, and as in any proposed change, human resources are usually the key parameter for its successful implementation. On its side, the People CMM model is a roadmap for implementing management practices of human resources that contributes to continuously improve the capacity of the workforce of an organization. From a systematic literature review a long list of success factors, barriers, motivators and de-motivator was obtained, which were grouped into 23 categories based on the similarity of the concepts underlying each factor. Eleven of these categories can be related to process areas of People CMM, according to the criteria that, given a category of factors, there exists one or more process areas of People CMM that, for its purposes and objectives, the implementation of its associated practices can help to strengthen the success factors and motivators, and to mitigate the resistance factors, barriers and de-motivators associated with that category.

In particular, we analyze the sensitivity of power output and thermal efficiency to the location of the ignition kernel and to the stroke-bore ratio. Whenever autoignition effects are not considered a centered ignition location returns the highest power output and efficiency (for intermediate and high speeds a centered spark plug leads to power improvements around 10% and efficiency improvements around 2%). It is explicitly shown that this corresponds to the maximum area development of the flame front and to minimum net work losses (including heat transfer, mechanical frictions and working fluid internal irreversibilities). On the other hand, the evolution of maximum power output and maximum efficiency is not linear with the stroke-bore ratio, Rsb. There is an optimum interval (Rsb ≃ 0.6-0.8) where it is possible to simultaneously obtain high power outputs and good efficiencies. We have also analyzed the optimum values of stroke-bore ratio that give the best efficiencies for certain intervals of the required power output. For power requirements over 2 kW, Rsb around 0.5-1.0 leads to 6% better efficiencies respect to other values. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

In this method, ultrasonic transducers are attached to the concrete surface using a coupling agent. The coupling process is both time and labor intensive and, in some cases, may limit the ability to collect data. This paper describes the development of a fully contact-less (air-coupled) UPV method. By adding a matching layer between the transducer crystal and air and using signal processing methods, air-coupled through-thickness compression wave measurements in concrete are made possible. A scanning test setup was proposed and applied to a concrete test specimen that had different thicknesses and contained internal defects. The thicknesses of the test specimen represent realistic values for concrete elements. Experimental results show that defects and thickness variations within the concrete were visualized when the UPV data were presented in a two-dimensional (2D) scan image. A data interpretation algorithm was used to accurately locate the embedded defects within the test specimen. Copyright © 2010. American Concrete Institute. All rights reserved."

Equivalently, a switched homogeneous system is statefeedback exponentially stabilizable if and only if an associated dynamic programming equation admits a solution on a given convex set. This unique solution of that associated dynamic programming equation is shown to be the optimal cost functional of a related infinite-horizon quadratic regulator problem (for the switched homogeneous system) whose solution is also presented.

Methods: aortic pressure, diameter and blood flow were measured in six anesthetized sheep with acute cardio-depression by halothane (4%), before and during IABP (1:2). aortic characteristic impedance and aortic wall stiffness indexes were calculated. Results: acute experimental cardio-depression resulted in a reduction in mean aortic pressure (p<0.05) and an increase in the characteristic impedance (p<0.005), incremental elastic modulus (p<0.05), stiffness index (p<0.05) and Peterson elastic modulus (p<0.05). IABP caused an increase in the cardiac output (p<0.005) and a reduction in the systemic vascular resistances (p<0.05). In addition, the aortic impedance, incremental elastic modulus, stiffness index and Peterson modulus were significantly reduced during IabP (p<0.05). Conclusions: our findings show that IabP caused changes in aortic wall impedance and intrinsic wall properties, improving the arterial functional capability and the left ventricular afterload by a reduction in both. Systemic vascular resistances and aortic stiffness were also improved by means of smooth muscle-dependent mechanisms. © Wichtig Editore, 2009."

We build on our recent work which combines ""dual"" congestion control for the traffic sources, with multipath routing at the router nodes, controlling the traffic split among outgoing links based on downstream congestion prices. The challenge is to obtain stabilization of the optimum point; in fact, controlling the split fractions following the price gradient has the correct equilibrium, but can lead to oscillatory instabilities. This suggests the use of derivative action to damp such oscillations. We study two alternatives in this regard; either anticipatory control of routing splits, which yields local stability in an arbitrary network topology, or anticipatory price generation, which yields a global result for the case of a network of parallel links. Proofs are based on a Lyapunov argument. Results are illustrated through simulations. © 2008 IEEE."

Films grow oriented with the (0 0 1) crystalline planes parallel or perpendicular to the substrate, according to X-ray diffraction. The influence of film orientation on electrical properties and on response to radiation was evaluated by measuring resistivity and response to X-rays. All the layers give good linearity of response to an X-ray beam. The sensitivity of the layers (signal to dark relation / exposure rate) is maximum (1380) for mercuric iodide.

To tackle this problem a multi-level approach is presented here, which is based on abstract functional models to capture the behavior of the whole system, and on detailed structural models to cope with the details of system components. In this paper we describe how the interaction between the two levels of abstraction is managed to provide accurate analysis of the dependability of the whole system. In particular, the proposed technique is shown to be able to identify faults affecting the CAN network whose effects are most likely to be critical for vehicle's dynamic.

Detectors were made with representative platelets by Pd or Au thermal deposition (contact areas of 0.03,0.02,0.12 cm2), Pd wire attachment with aquadag and acrylic encapsulation. TMZ crystals show a better surface crystal quality, but this fact does not seem to particularly influence the detector electrical properties. However, the metal used for electrode deposition determines the resistivity, and Au emerges as better than Pd for this purpose. Detector X-ray response was measured by irradiation with a 241 Am source of 3.5 mR/h. Resistivities up to 2.0 × 1012 Ω · cm were obtained, the best reported for detectors made with monocrystals of this material, which correlates with the fact that these detectors are the first BiI3 ones that respond to an X-ray moderate radiation exposure. Platelets obtained in the present work give detector but not spectrometric grade material."

Polycrystalline rhodium and chemical etched electrodes were characterized by voltammetry, Cu underpotential deposition (upd) and X-ray diffraction. For electrofaceted surfaces were used voltammetry, Cu upd and SEM, revealing that two modified rhodium electrodes exhibit similar voltammetric characteristics as those found for Rh(111) and Rh(110) single crystals, and a third surface with an equal distribution of (110) and (111) planes. In addition, the upd of Cu on those surfaces corroborated the existence of those crystallographic planes. SEM micrographs show surface structures with a high density of terraces and steps.

The solution obtained by acid attack of the solid wastes was treated with ultraviolet irradiation in the presence of titanium dioxide and an organic agent (citric acid), leading to the selective precipitation of reduced mercury, while the other metal compounds remained in the solution. In spite of the large excess of non-reducible metal ions (100 times or more on a molar basis), more than 99% of the mercury initially present in the solid wastes was removed. Competitive adsorption of the different metal compounds on the titanium dioxide surface led to lower rates of mercury reduction. This combined process can be an efficient alternative method for mercury separation because the final effluents have reached a quality close to that of the standards imposed by international environmental agencies."

Sequential and competitive adsorption of a-HSA IgG and RSA were performed. Colloidal stability of immunolatex was improved by RSA adsorption, especially in the competitive adsorption. In this last case, the immunological agglutination reactions of physically adsorbed IgG molecules onto anionic particles have been investigated by means of optical absorbance measurements. These measurements have been conducted under different experimental conditions to determine the most influential factors. Surface IgG and BSA densities, particle concentration in the reaction medium, and polyethylene glycol concentration are some of these factors.

Oil is particularly responsible for functional serviceability of the entire insulation system. The insulating oil must be kept in pristine condition, since its condition can be a decisive factor, which determines the life span of the transformer. Fields and laboratory experiences have shown that transformer oil contains a vast amount of information. Oil analyses can be extremely useful in monitoring the condition of power transformers. To meet pressing needs of power industries, fast, inexpensive and reliable laboratory testing procedures are necessary. To ensure long-term reliability of oil filled power transformers, it is important to identify early sign of degradation of the insulating oil. In this paper, oil degradation was monitored with various ASTM test methods. Investigations were performed on service-aged oil samples as well as on oil samples aged in laboratory conditions. Many key parameters actually used to monitor the condition of transformer oil relative to oxidation/degradation were investigated. From the obtained results, correlations were found between some of them. The results indicate that Dissolved Decay Products (DDP) and turbidity, which change with a higher rate than interfacial tension (IFT) and Acid Number (AN) values, can be possibly used as an effective index for insulating oil degradation assessment. Limits are suggested which provide a ""picture"" of the fluid condition. © 1994-2012 IEEE."

Ozone is one of the most powerful oxidizing agents and is applied in gaseous or aqueous form for sanitation purposes. However, the strong oxidative effect could affect the nutritional and sensorial quality, in particular, when time of washing is extended. For that reason, the overall impact of ozonated water (0.4 mg/L) dipping applied during 1, 3 and 5 min compared to control washed in water during 5 min was studied in tomato slices stored during 14 days at 5 °c. According to the results, ozonated water treatment of 3 min achieved the best firmness retention, microbial quality (mesophilic, psychrotrophic and yeas load) and reduced the consumption of fructose and glucose. The use of ozonated water did not affect the total acidity, pH, total solid soluble, organic acid as ascorbic, fumaric or succinic acid and the sensorial parameters, which were only affected by storage time. However, the poor appearance, aroma and overall quality obtained in all treatments prevented shelf life of 14 days and the quality at acceptable levels was established in 10 days at 5 °c. It is recommended to wash tomato slices with 0.4 mg/L ozonated water for 3 min only. Extending treatment duration did not improve the microbiological quality, possibly due to the extra time permitting the ozone to react with other components of the fruit tissue, undermining the antimicrobial benefits. © The Author(s) 2013."

The suitability of these complexes for efficient adsorption of microorganisms was expected on account of their large surface areas, large excess of positive charge, and existence of large hydrophobic domains. Tests included removal from water of bacteria: Gram negative (Escherichia coli K-12), Gram positive (Bacillus megaterium), and a protozoan parasite, Cryptosporidium parvum. Micelles of the organic cations Benzyldimethylhexadecylammonium (BDMHDA), or Octadecyltrimethylammonium complexed with the clay-mineral montmorillonite were shown to reduce by 3-6 orders of magnitude the numbers of microorganisms in water as tested in suspension and by filters (20 cm in length) packed with the complexes mixed with excess sand (100:1, w/w). Respiration tests demonstrated that E. coli K-12 cells adsorbed to micelle (BDMHDA)-montmorillonite complex lost their viability. Kinetics of filtration of E. coli by two filters in series was adequately simulated by a model which considers convection, adsorption. and desorption. Filtration of E. coli K-12 cells demonstrated that they stayed adsorbed and inactivated by the complex within the column filter without re-growth in water. These results suggest that filters including micelle-montmorillonite composites can secure the safety of drinking water in case of threatening increases in the number of pathogenic microorganisms in the water. © 2013 © 2013 Balaban Desalination Publications."

In this work, the authors propose one-dimensional transient elastography (1DTE) for the shear modulus assessment of thin-layered soft tissue. Experiments on three phantoms with different elasticities and plate thicknesses were performed. First, using 1DTE, the shear wave speed dispersion curve inside the plate was obtained and validated with finite difference simulation. No dispersive effects were observed and the shear wave speed was directly retrieved from time-of-flight measurements. Second, the supersonic shear imaging (SSI) technique (considered to be a gold standard) was performed. For the SSI technique, the propagating wave inside the plate is guided as a Lamb wave. Experimental SSI dispersion curves were compared with finite difference simulation and fitted using a generalized Lamb model to retrieve the plate bulk shear wave speed. Although they are based on totally different mechanical sources and induce completely different diffraction patterns for the shear wave propagation, the 1DTE and SSI techniques resulted in similar shear wave speed estimations. The main advantage of the 1DTE technique is that bulk shear wave speed can be directly retrieved without requiring a dispersion model. © 2012 IEEE."

Service capacity for a certain content adjusts dynamically as a function of peer population, thus achieving scalability. This dynamic behavior has been the subject of recent analytical studies. In this paper, we propose a partial differential equation model for BitTorrent-like systems, in which a fluid variable represents content and its distribution in the system is taken into account. This model allows for a variety of file sharing disciplines; we identify equilibrium properties that must hold regardless of this choice, and others that depend on a notion of efficiency. The equilibrium properties of many specific disciplines are described. Through a discretized ordinary differential equation model, we also present results on the stability of the equilibrium for a particular sharing policy that is suitable to model current BitTorrent systems. © 2011 IEEE."

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the sensory profile, the polyphenolic (PP) content and 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging capacity of solvent extracts of three native Uruguayan plants: Achyrocline satureoides, Baccharis trimera, and Mikania guaco. Extraction solvent and native plant remarkably affected the PP content, the radical scavenging capacity, and the sensory profile of the extracts. Water extracts were the most effective radical scavengers and showed the highest polyphenolic concentration and the lowest intensity of bitter, astringent, and characteristic flavor. The bitterness, astringency and characteristic flavor of the extracts could limit their use as functional ingredients. Thus, when optimizing the extraction of antioxidant compounds from plants, apart from studying the influence of extraction solvents on yield, PP content and antioxidant capacity, the sensory characteristics of the antioxidant extracts should also be taken into account. © 2010 Taylor & Francis."

The presence in the supernatant of serotype-specific CPS (capsular polysaccharide) during growth was followed by size-exclusion HPLC and, in parallel, confirmed by using a specific latex reagent. The agitation level did not affect the production behaviour, whereas pH maintenance above 6 strongly enhanced both growth and CPS production throughout the cultivation period in flasks. Production of high-molecular-mass polysaccharide was found to be maximal between 5 and 6 h of cultivation, at the end of the exponential phase. By laser light scattering, 90% of this purified CPS product showed a Mw (molecular mass) range from 350 to 1500 kDa, with an average Mw of 921 kDa. Extending the culture to 24 h gave rise to a clear shift of the Mw distribution of the polysaccharide to values lower than 100 kDa. These findings may have strong implications for the large-scale manufacture of the polysaccharide and the associated conjugate vaccine. © 2010 Portland Press Ltd."

In a first formulation of the inverse optimization problem we minimize the difference between the target and the equilibrium shapes while in a second approach we minimize the L 2 norm of a fictitious surface pressure that makes the target shape to be in mechanical equilibrium. Geometric constraints that prevent the inductors from penetrating the liquid metal are considered in both formulations.

Butterhead lettuce was washed and placed under ambient air in 30 × 40 cm polypropylene bags, and stored at 5, 10 and 15C. A first-order equation was obtained for the development of the evaluated appearance sensory attributes as a function of storage time. For all the evaluated storage temperatures, microbiological shelf lives (14, 17 and 42 days at 5, 10 and 15C) were higher than estimated sensory shelf lives (8, 14 and 26 days at 5, 10 and 15C), showing that shelf life of lettuce in passive modified atmosphere packages was limited by sensory properties and not by microbial growth. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Sensory shelf life of lettuce in passive modified atmosphere packages was estimated using consumer data, which are an improvement of a more arbitrary criteria presented in most studies. Moreover, if failure criteria used in other studies were applied, consumer rejection at the end of shelf life would be higher, suggesting that more conservative criteria are necessary to assure the product's quality at the end of its shelf life. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

However, the relationship between these models and UML design models is not straightforward. The contribution of this work is the proposal of an extension of UML statecharts, which consists of introducing variability in their main components, so that the behavior of product lines can be specified. This is accomplished via the use of feature models, in order to describe the common and variant components, in such a way that, starting from different feature configurations, concrete state machines corresponding to different products of a line can be obtained. © 2008 IEEE."

By following the slow coherency methodology, the generators that oscillate coherently at the lowest natural frequencies of the interconnected system were identified with the help of the respective mode shapes. The corresponding linear model was built with second order classical generators models. In a second step, the coherent generators were clustered at the level of their internal nodes, building in this way the corresponding inertial equivalents. Finally, the system was reduced again with the help of classical linear techniques for the computation of static equivalents. The final result is an equivalent model of the Argentinian system that includes approximately 20% of the original machines and less than 5% of its nodes. The equivalent model was validated through the comparison of the transient response of the Uruguayan system to a set of significant faults. ©2008 IEEE."

In the first place read is not able to handle the associativities defined for infix operators. Furthermore, it puts constraints on the way show is defined, and especially forces it to generate far more parentheses than expected. Lastly, it may give rise to exponential parsing times. All this is due to the compositionality requirement for read functions, which imposes a top-down parsing strategy. We propose a different approach, based on typed abstract syntax, in which grammars describing the data types are composed dynamically. Using the transformation libraries described in a companion paper these syntax descriptions are combined and transformed into parsers at runtime, from which the required read function are constructed. In this way we obtain linear parsing times, achieve consistency with the defined associativities, and may use a version of show which generates far fewer parentheses, thus improving readability of printed values. The described transformation algorithms can be incorporated in a Haskell compiler, thus moving most of the work involved to compile time. Copyright © 2008 ACM."

Urban noise measurements need to be dense enough to provide a good spatial representation of noise levels in the region. They must also extend over a long enough period of time to be stable and reliable, but not extremely long in order not to increase field work expense beyond acceptable levels. Data from field measurement programs carried out to obtain a noise map might also be used to develop predictive noise models in order to update the noise map, or to evaluate noise impact of possible traffic management changes (circulation patterns, bus ways, etc.). Predictive model application in the same city for which they were developed is a guarantee of the adequacy of the tool, especially when model precision and range of applicability is specified. If no precision or applicability range is given, unpredictable errors can occur without any basis for analysis. This paper compares recommended noise measurement durations for three different cities: a European city (Valencia, Spain); a South American city (Montevideo, Uruguay); and a small town in Uruguay (Rivera). Predictive models are then used in all three cases and their outputs are compared. Differences are large enough to show the risks of using predictive models developed for cities with different characteristics (urban, social and cultural differences, including different recommended noise measurement duration), even when hourly traffic volume would suggest its applicability. © 2007 Institute of Noise Control Engineering."

The technology also has been an enabler for heavy-oil developments [American Petroleum Inst. (API) gravity <20°, y>0.934] in Brazil and the North Sea that otherwise would have been uneconomical.

Due to their size, small compounds cannot be simultaneously recognized by two antibodies impeding their detection by noncompetitive two-site immunoassays, which are superior to competitive ones in terms of sensitivity, kinetics, and working range. In this work, we combine the advantages of magneto-electrochemical immunosensors with the improved sensitivity and direct proportional signal of noncompetitive immunoassays to develop a new Phage Anti-Immunocomplex Electrochemical Immunosensor (PhAIEI) for the detection of the herbicide atrazine. The noncompetitive assay is based on the use of recombinant M13 phage particles bearing a peptide that specifically recognizes the immunocomplex of atrazine with an anti-atrazine monoclonal antibody. The PhAIEI performed with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.2pgmL-1, which is 200-fold better than the LOD obtained using the same antibody in an optimized conventional competitive ELISA, with a large increase in working range. The developed PhAIEI was successfully used to assay undiluted river water samples with no pretreatment and excellent recoveries. Apart from the first demonstration of the benefits of integrating phage anti-immunocomplex particles into electrochemical immunosensors, the extremely low and environmentally relevant detection limits of atrazine attained with the PhAIEIS may have direct applicability to fast and sensitive detection of this herbicide in the environment. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

Data collected from 2005 to 2012 clearly show that bruising and other damage to beef and pork carcasses can be greatly reduced by training truck drivers and handlers, and by simple improvements in facilities. Poor design and operation of the door on the beef stunning box caused 36.5% of the bruises. After training and improvements, the percentage of cattle bruised was halved. Cattle that passed through markets on the way to slaughter had four times the risk of having meat of a high pH (>5.8) compared with cattle that were shipped direct. Another advantage of the adoption of low stress handling methods is less stress on the stock people. During cattle truck loading, the elimination of electric prods, hitting and shouting reduced bruising from over two per carcass to less than one. When better methods are used for handling cattle, corrals can be built from less expensive and more economical, for example solid fences that block the animal's vision can be constructed from vertical bamboo strips attached to a wire or wood plank fence. The chapter also provides details of a low cost corral layout and photos of typical South American trucks. The training of handlers and the installation of non-slip floors, solid shields to block cattle vision and head holders improved stunning and reduced both vocalization and the use of electric prods. Further improvements are still needed. In one study, for instance, 17% of the cattle vocalized and 38% struggled in the stun box. A vocalization percentage of 5% or less is an achievable goal. © CAB International 2014. All rights reserved."

The objective of this work is to develop a new methodology of data analysis based on phase space graphs of temperature and enthalpy, collected by means of multidistributed, low cost and autonomous wireless sensors and loggers. A transoceanic refrigerated transport of lemons in a reefer container ship from Montevideo (Uruguay) to Cartagena (Spain) was monitored with a network of 39 semi-passive TurboTag RFID loggers and 13 i-button loggers. Transport included intermodal transit from transoceanic to short shipping vessels and a truck trip. Data analysis is carried out using qualitative phase diagrams computed on the basis of Takens-Ruelle reconstruction of attractors. Fruit stress is quantified in terms of the phase diagram area which characterizes the cyclic behaviour of temperature. Areas within the enthalpy phase diagram computed for the short sea shipping transport were 5 times higher than those computed for the long sea shipping, with coefficients of variation above 100 % for both periods. This new methodology for data analysis highlights the significant heterogeneity of thermohygrometric conditions at different locations in the container. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

However, current sensor technologies still exhibit some unresolved issues which hampers their direct application into everyday life. Conducting polymers, such as polypyrrole (PPy), are increasingly being adopted as suitable platforms for DNA probe immobilization and signal transduction. Immobilization of DNA probes during pyrrole electropolymerization is a simple and efficient strategy to build composite electrodes suitable for DNA sensing. However, the effects of the probe state and sequence on PPy growth kinetics have not been studied yet. Here, we show that growth of PPy is drastically affected by the presence of guanine in the DNA probes and whether DNA is present in its single-stranded or double-stranded form. We show that some immobilization protocols may provoke irreversible oxidation of guanine moieties in the probe and that this issue deserves careful investigation as it may interfere with hybridization processes. We have also explored new procedures to build microelectrode arrays bearing immobilized DNA molecules, which are known to show beneficial properties in stirred samples. Overall, we present new techniques and concerns regarding the development of DNA-containing PPy-based composite electrodes, which may be taken into consideration for increasing genosensor reproducibility, response and performance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."

In this context, the aim of the present work was to apply a combination of sensory and consumer methodologies to the development of chocolate milk desserts enriched with resistant starch. Chocolate milk desserts containing modified waxy maize starch were formulated with six different concentrations of two types of resistant starch (which are part of insoluble dietary fiber). The desserts were evaluated by trained assessors using Quantitative Descriptive Analysis. Moreover, consumers scored their overall liking and willingness to purchase and answered an open-ended question. Resistant starch caused significant changes in the sensory characteristics of the desserts and a significant decrease in consumers' overall liking and willingness to purchase. Consumer data was analyzed applying survival analysis on overall liking scores, considering the risk on consumers liking and willing to purchase the functional products less than their regular counterparts. The proposed methodologies proved to be useful to develop functional foods taking into account consumers' perception, which could increase their success in the market. © 2011 The Author(s)."

The approach comprises a diagnosis stage to select the promising variables through a sensitivity analysis, an evaluation stage to assess the impact of the promising variables, and to identify the most important factors through RSM. A reduced model from the process response behavior is built, and an optimization is carried out with the reduced model to identify optimal conditions and performance of the system, subject to objective function and model constraints. All these procedures are simulation-supported. The main advantage of the proposed approach is to handle a large industrial-scale design problem within a reasonable computational effort and to obtain a reduced model based on the most important factors. Limitations for the developed method include that the global optimality of the solutions found is not fully guaranteed, while large computational time for simulation may be required when the large number of factors and levels need to be considered, although this is offset by the reduced optimization time. The proposed Retrofit Design Approach has been applied to the NGL (natural gas liquids) recovery process, in which steady-state process simulation using Aspen Plus TM has been carried out, and complex design interactions existed for retrofit scenarios have been systematically evaluated, leading to optimal strategies for retrofitting through the proposed design method. Both the continuous and discrete design options are considered in the retrofit design, and the results showed that the approach is effective to provide reliable, cost-effective solutions which yield to economic and environmental improvements in the studied processes. The promising sets of retrofit design options were presented as a portfolio of investment opportunities for supporting further decision-making procedures. © 2011 American Chemical Society."

The subsequent adsorption of glucoamylase (GA) onto calcined bone particles was assessed. Adsorption capacity of the calcined matrix was found to be from 1.1- to 1.4-fold superior to that of non-calcined supports, and it was dependent on the applied load. Moreover, the expressed activity of GA derivatives on calcined matrix was, at least, 2-fold higher than that of biocatalysts onto non-calcined support. The optimization of the loading allowed the preparation of derivatives with 139 GA units per gram of support, which preserve 52% of the immobilized activity. Additionally, calcination of spent GA biocatalysts on calcined bone particles was performed, and adsorption of glucoamylase onto the bone particles calcined a second time was also found to be efficient. In addition to the improved catalytic properties, the half-life at 55°C of the GA biocatalysts on calcined bone was increased 1.7-fold in comparison with that of soluble GA and GA adsorbed onto non-calcined bone particles.

If the step length is considered ""non serious"", a cutting plane is added and a new search direction is computed. This procedure is repeated until a ""serious"" step is obtained. When this happens, the search direction is a feasible descent direction of the constrained equivalent problem. To compute the search directions we employ the same formulation as in FDIPA, the Feasible Directions Interior Point Algorithm for constrained optimization. We prove global convergence of the present method. A set of numerical tests is described. The present technique was also successfully applied to the topology optimization of robust trusses. Our results are comparable to those obtained with other well known established methods. © 2011 Springer-Verlag."

A number of flight balloons that were built based on the constantbulge-angle, constant-bulge- radius, and hybrid design strategies encountered deployment problems. In June 2006, Flight 555-NT (a hybrid design) formed an S-cleft and did not deploy. Currently, NASA's approach to superpressure balloon design uses a constant-stress model developed at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. To fully understand the mechanism behind cleft formation in pumpkin balloons and to explore the constant-stress design space, NASA's Balloon Program Office carried out a series of inflation tests in 2007 involving four 27-meter-diameter 200-gore pumpkin balloons. One of the test vehicles was a one-third-scale mockup of the Flight 555-NT balloon. Using an inflation procedure intended to mimic ascent, the one-third-scale mockup developed an S-cleft feature that was strikingly similar to the one observed in Flight 555-NT. The remaining three 27-meter balloons tested were constantstress designs and deployed properly. In an effort to gauge constant-stress design susceptibility to deployment problems, we carry out a number of parametric studies and assess the stability landscape of the constant-stress design space. In our studies, we examine two types of top end-fitting boundary conditions, one restrictive and one less restrictive, that help to define a cleft-free design envelope. We correlate our analytical predictions with outcomes of inflation tests involving 27-meter-diameter test vehicles and outcomes from flight 586-NT and flight 591-NT, which involved larger constant-stress designs. To study scaling effects, we consider a 14-million-cubic-foot design. Our analysis suggests that as one scales up the balloon, the size of the cleft-free envelope shrinks.

Today, the increasing popularity of sophisticated DfT architectures and the parallel emergence of new ATE families allow the identification of innovative solutions effectively facing that goal. In this paper we face the increasingly common situation of SoCs adopting the IEEE 1149.1 and 1500 standards for the test of the internal cores, and explore the idea of storing the test program on the tester in a compressed form, and decompressing it on-the-fly during test application. This paper proposes an improved version of an data compression/decompression technique which is well suited for reducing the size of test programs stored on the tester; this technique is particularly effective for very long sequential test vectors generated to test SoCs by means of low-cost test procedures; thus, the paper outlines the characteristics of an FPGA-based low-cost tester platform that takes advantage of the described compression schema. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology was demonstrated by practically testing some SoCs equipped with suitable DfT for supporting low-cost testing resorting to a low-cost tester implementing the proposed architecture and the compression/decompression technique. © 2009 IEEE."

During the last 40 years of the 20th century, despite considerable fishing effort involving subsurface longline fleets from more than seven countries, there were few available data describing catch rates and relative abundances and distributions of the species caught. The majority of information came from small-scale longline fleets operating out of Brazil and Uruguay, where sharks historically have been landed and sold in local markets. This review shows that most of the large-scale temporal fluctuations in catch per unit of effort (numbers or weights of fish caught per 1,000 hooks per year) in these small-scale fisheries can be attributed to market-oriented factors (reflecting variabilities in consumer demand for various species) and the discovery of new fishing grounds. Toward the end of the century, gear-related changes also appear to have had an impact on catch rates. The lack of data precludes analyses of smaller-scale temporal and spatial trends in catches and relative abundances for nearly all species, except the blue shark (Prionace glauca). The available data indicate that such trends in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean can be largely attributed to movements associated with reproduction. We propose that the future effective management of pelagic sharks in the South Atlantic would be facilitated by implementation of more rigorous methods of obtaining information on catches and biological parameters for the key species, as well as an examination of the factors influencing gear selectivity. © 2008 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Recent works have proposed robust optimization techniques to cope with uncertain traffic, computing a stable routing configuration that is immune to demand variations within certain uncertainty set. However, using a single routing configuration for long-time periods can be highly inefficient. Even more, the presence of abnormal and malicious traffic has magnified the network operation problem, claiming for solutions which not only deal with traffic uncertainty but also allow to identify faulty traffic. In this paper, we propose two complementary methods to tackle both problems. Based on expected traffic patterns, we adapt the uncertainty set and build a multi-hour yet robust routing scheme that outperforms the stable approach. For the case of anomalous and unexpected traffic, we propose a fast anomaly detection/isolation algorithm which relies on a novel linear spline-based model of traffic demands to identify traffic problems and decide routing changes. This algorithm is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the decision delay for a given mean false alarm rate and false isolation probabilities. Both proposals are validated using real traffic data from two Internet backbone networks. ©2008 IEEE."

In this algebraic formalism, the truth values map on orthonormal Q-dimensional vectors, the monadic operations are represented by square matrices, and the dyadic operations produce rectangular matrices that act on the Kronecker product of the vector truth values. In this formalism, the theorems and tautologies of classical logic are demonstrated using the rules of matrix algebra. In the present work, we analyse a three-valued vector logic that adds to the 'yes' and 'no' vectors, a third 'uncertain' vector that represents the truth value corresponding to undecidable propositions. Fuzziness is produced both via linear combinations of 'yes' and 'no' vectors, and by the supplementary dimension of the logical vector subspace. We describe the basic matrix operators, and we show that for this three-valued vector logic, the modalities 'possibility' and 'necessity' are simple square matrices instead of infinite recursive processes. Finally, we explore the application of this formalism to represent the complex-valued operatorNOT, and the usefulness of vector logic to understand the powers and limitations of some reversible logical computations."

This dynamical study was designed to characterize the pressure-dependent and smooth muscle-dependent effects of IABP on aortic wall energetics in an in vivo animal model. Intra-aortic balloon pumping (1:2) was performed in six anesthetized sheep in which aortic pressure and diameter signals were measured in basal, augmented (during balloon inflation), and assisted (postaugmented) beats. Energy dissipation values in augmented and assisted beats were significantly higher than those observed in basal state (p < 0.05). Assisted beats showed a significant increase of wall damping with respect to basal and augmented beats (p < 0.05). Intra-aortic balloon pumping resulted in a significant increase of pulse wave velocity (p < 0.05) in augmented beats with respect to basal state (6.3 ± 0.8 vs. 5.2 ± 0.5 m·s); whereas values observed in assisted beats were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than those observed in augmented beats (4.9 ± 0.5 vs. 6.3 ± 0.8 m·s).

Shape information is introduced through a higher dimensional map similar to a distance map of a mean shape. Segmentation results are demonstrated on ultrasound imagery to measure meat quality of bovine and ovine livestock."

If diffraction grid effect is present, it results in an important energy loss in the higher diffraction orders.

The helical flow is assumed to be irrotational, except in a vortex filament of infinitesimal core area. By introducing an appropriate image for this helical vortex filament, the boundary condition on the material frontier is satisfied. By assuming an axisymmetric flow upstream and imposing the conservation laws, a dependence between the helix pitch and the nonlinear amplitude of the helical vortex developed downstream is obtained. Our results show that only helical flows with the pitch in a certain range of values are allowed. The dependence of this range on the swirl ratio and on the tube cross section is considered.

The as-grown surface uniformity is higher for solution grown crystals than that of PVT crystals, since the platelets do not have to be cleaved or polished. AFM studies show that the roughness for the cleaved, aged and etched surfaces were 0.06 nm, 0.48 nm and 0.3 nm respectively. Low temperature photoluminescence properties were measured for the two kind of crystals and will be discussed.

The central objective of this study is to corroborate the structural behaviour of these walls in experimental and numerical terms. It follows a three-step methodology: a full-scale experimental campaign; development of a Finite Element Model (FEM) capable of predicting the structural behaviour of the wall; and, assessment of the second layer contribution. The experimental campaign confirmed the viability of the constructive solution and the FEM model accurately reflected the experimental data.

In this work the use of vector autorregresive (VAR) and Regime Switching VAR models for the simulation of wave height, period and direction, and wind speed and direction, is studied. In order to normalize and stationarize the series, non-stationary mixture uni-variate distributions arefitted to the above five variables. Then three different VAR models (one standard model and two regime switching models) are fitted and new time series are simulated. Finally, an in depth analysis of the long term simulations is performed, in order to study its ability to reproduce the behavior of the original series.It is found that VAR models are able to capture main features of the original series, but they fail in reproducing some of the persistence regimes and some aspects of the bivariate distributions.

However, if IABP results in changes in the peripheral artery biomechanics and if the endothelium plays a role in these potential changes remains unknown. The aim of this study is to characterize acute IABP effects on peripheral artery biomechanics in control and acute heart failure (AHF) states and the role of the endothelium in IABP effects on peripheral artery biomechanics. Pressure and diameter were recorded in sheep (n= 7) iliac arteries (IAs), before and during 1:2 IABP, during four states: (i) control with intact IA; (ii) AHF with intact IA; (iii) control with de-endothelialized (DE) (mechanical rubbing) IA; and (iv) AHF with DE IA. Arterial distensibility, elastic modulus, and conduit function (CF) (1/characteristic impedance) were calculated. The results of this study include: (i) during control conditions, IABP resulted in intact IA dilatation, stiffness reduction, and CF increase; (ii) AHF induction determined a reduction in intact IA diameter and CF, and a stiffness increase. These changes reverted during IABP; (iii) the increase in IA stiffness observed after DE remained unchanged during IABP; (iv) in DE IA, AHF did not result in diameter or stiffness changes; and (v) IABP during AHF did not associate changes in diameter or stiffness in the DE IA. In conclusion, during control and AHF states, IABP results in IA dilatation and stiffness reduction. The integrity of the endothelial layer would be critical for the IABP-associated changes in IA biomechanics. © 2011, the Authors.

The approach is based on C-HiLasso, a convex collaborative hierarchical sparse model, and proceeds as follows. First, we build a structured dictionary for mixed signals by concatenating a set of sub-dictionaries, each one of them learned to sparsely model one of a set of possible classes. Then, the coding of the mixed signal is performed by efficiently solving a convex optimization problem that combines standard sparsity with group and collaborative sparsity. The present sources are identified by looking at the sub-dictionaries automatically selected in the coding. The collaborative filtering in C-HiLasso takes advantage of the temporal/spatial redundancy in the mixed signals, letting collections of samples collaborate in identifying the classes, while allowing individual samples to have different internal sparse representations. This collaboration is critical to further stabilize the sparse representation of signals, in particular the class/sub-dictionary selection. The internal sparsity inside the sub-dictionaries, as naturally incorporated by the hierarchical aspects of C-HiLasso, is critical to make the model consistent with the essence of the sub-dictionaries that have been trained for sparse representation of each individual class. We present applications from speaker and instrument identification and texture separation. In the case of audio signals, we use sparse modeling to describe the short-term power spectrum envelopes of harmonic sounds. The proposed pitch independent method automatically detects the number of sources on a recording. © 2011 IEEE."

They can be regarded as a swarm of genetically related mutants around a dominant or master genetic sequence. This system is called a 'viral quasi-species'. Thus, a common framework to describe RNA viral dynamics is by means of the quasi-species equation (QSE). The QSE is in fact a system of a very large number of nonlinear coupled equations. Here, we consider a simpler formulation in terms of 'error classes', which groups all the sequences differing from the master sequence by the same number of genomic differences into one population class.

The intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP), the device most frequently used in circulatory support, acts generating changes in aortic flow (i.e. increasing reversal flow). Recently, in vitro studies showed that flow reversion reduces the endothelial release of relaxing factors. Hence, vascular smooth muscle (VSM) dependent changes in the aortic properties would be expected during IABP. The aim was to analyze the changes in flow during IABP and to characterize the potential effects of reversal blood flow on the aortic biomechanics. Pressure, flow and diameter were measured in sheep, before and during IABP circulatory support. Potential effects of IABP-dependent high reversal flow conditions on viscous and elastic aortic modulus were analyzed, using isobaric analysis. Flow and pressure waveforms were analyzed in the time domain, and the contribution of oscillatory forward and backward waves to the IABP-dependent changes in flow patterns were evaluated. We found that IABP changed mainly diastolic blood flow, with an increase in the reversal flow, secondary to an increase in the oscillatory backward wave amplitude. The acute increase in reversal flow during IABP was associated with vasoconstriction and changes in the aortic mechanics, possibly due to VSM activation. © 2007 IEEE."

Differences in vein dynamics during physiological situations could determine differences in veins' capability to face arterial conditions and could contribute to the dissimilar performance of veins as arterial grafts. In vitro pressure and diameter were measured in four different veins during physiological and arterial (graft) pressure conditions. A diameter-pressure transfer function was designed. Compliance, viscous and inertial properties; circumferential stresses and deformation; and buffering function were calculated. Regional differences in veins' dynamics, but not in buffering function were found during physiological and arterial conditions.

The configuration uses a crystal with a large common electrode on the front face, and one, or more, small electrodes on the back face, leading to localized sensing regions. Each back electrode is capacitively coupled to a separated tip electrode. The tip consists of a small disc and a guard ring, which confine the electric field to the electrode area and make the measurement unaffected by the stray parallel capacitances. Analysis shows that the proposed configuration can be modeled as an extension of the Butterworth-Van Dyke (BVD) circuit and that, by a proper choice of the reference frequency around resonance, it is possible to obtain frequency readings that do not depend on the tip-to-crystal stand-off distance. Experimental results show that a mass load added on the front electrode can be consistently detected and measured irrespective of the tip-to-crystal stand-off distance. © 2005 IEEE."

The pulse goes through a region of parallel cylindrical wires, uniformly spaced and perpendicular to the acoustic beam.

[Opt. Commun. 115 (1995) 297]. In the model we incorporate carrier capture and escape processes between the separate confinement heterostructure (SCH) layer and the quantum well (QW) active region of a VCSEL. These effects are characterized with phenomenological capture and escape times, τcap,τesc. We show analytically and by numerical simulations that when the carrier loss in the SCH region is taken into account, carrier capture and escape critically affects the transverse-mode selection of a VCSEL. A large ratio between τcap and τesc diminishes the number of photons in the QWs, leading to a decrease of the spatial-hole burning, which in turn benefits emission on the fundamental transverse mode. On the contrary, a small ratio between τcap and τesc increases the number of photons in the QWs, leading to a large spatial-hole burning which in turn favors higher-order transverse modes. If the carrier loss in the SCH region is neglected the total number of photons in the QW region is independent of τcap and τesc. In this case carrier capture and escape play no fundamental role in the transverse-mode selection of the VCSEL, but modify the transient dynamics of the relaxation oscillations. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The stability of a planar interface and that of a ledge geometry, as suggested by previous experimental work, are examined. Results indicate that the associated stress distribution makes the former geometry intrinsically unstable while for the latter it ensured its stability during the propagation of the front. In addition to the theoretical support given to Lüders front propagation by the ledge mechanism, the calculations give a stress concentration factor of 1.5 ± 0.2 for the elastic material at the tip of the advancing ledges. The stress distribution behind the front becomes homogeneous at a distance of the order of the grain diameter from the interface indicating thus that a significant fraction of the final Lüders deformation should be accountable for by creep. Combining the calculated stress distribution with an experimentally determined strain profile the stress-strain history of the material behind the front is reconstructed.

An enhancement in the lithium conductivity in more than one order of magnitude was observed for all nanocomposites, in respect to LLTO-unloaded polymer, showing a maximum lithium conductivity of σtotal~1.13×10−4 S/cm at room temperature, for a 50 nm LLTO crystallite mean size addition. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

Spiking experiments with norovirus genogroup II genotype 4 (NoV GII.4) and murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1) demonstrated that the organic flocculation method associated with a glycine elution buffer, filter bag and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) showed a recovery percentage of 2.5 and 32 times higher than PEG precipitation and filtration methodologies for NoV recovering. Furthermore, this method was used for investigating NoV and human adenoviruses (HAdVs) in 90 samples of fresh strawberries commercialized in Rio de Janeiro markets. NoV GI and GII were not detected in those samples and MNV-1, used as internal process control (IPC), was recovered in 95.5% (86) of them. HAdVs were detected in 18 (20.0%) samples and characterized by nucleotide sequencing as Human Mastadenovirus specie F and as type specie HAdV-2.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the anthocyanin composition of red wines produced by alternative procedures of winemaking and different grape varieties. For this purpose, wines of Tannat, Syrah and Merlot were made by traditional maceration (TM), addition of maceration enzymes (ENZ) and cold soak (CS). Syrah wines had the highest proportions of malvidin (86.0 ± 1.0) and peonidin (5.5 ± 0.4), while Tannat wines had the highest of delphinidin (6.9 ± 0.8), petunidin (13.2 ± 0.6) and nonacylated glucosides (73.6 ± 0.6). Cold soak increased the anthocyanins contents in Tannat and Merlot wines. In turn, maceration enzymes affect the anthocyanin profile and the stability of the colour of wines. Discriminant analysis of data showed significant separation of the wines of each variety as the anthocyanin profile showed the varietal fingerprint, despite the different winemaking procedures. © 2016 Institute of Food Science and Technology."

Video quality is, however, subjective, and thus, there will always be interobserver differences in the subjective opinion about the visual quality of the same video. Despite this, most existing works on objective quality measurement typically focus only on predicting a single score and evaluate their prediction accuracies based on how close it is to the mean opinion scores (or similar average based ratings). Clearly, such an approach ignores the underlying diversities in the subjective scoring process and, as a result, does not allow further analysis on how reliable the objective prediction is in terms of subjective variability. Consequently, the aim of this paper is to analyze this issue and present a machine-learning based solution to address it. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas by considering the practical scenario of video broadcast transmissions with focus on digital terrestrial television (DTT) and proposing a no-reference objective video quality estimator for such application. We conducted meaningful verification studies on different video content (including video clips recorded from real DTT broadcast transmissions) in order to verify the performance of the proposed solution. © 2015 SPIE and ISandT."

The specific absorption and scattering coefficients, as well as the phase function for scattering, were obtained as a function of the wavelength in the range from 300 to 500 nm. Optical properties of the Fe-PILCs are greatly affected by their iron contents which are ascribed to changes in their textural properties and are significantly different from those of two other iron containing materials, goethite and zerovalent iron. To show an application of the optical properties, the quantum e fficiency of the heterogeneous photo-Fenton process with a Fe-PILC was determined.

This paper reports on the 2011 edition of the Virtual Intracranial Stenting Challenge. The challenge aimed to assess the reproducibility with which research groups can simulate the velocity field in an intracranial aneurysm, both untreated and treated with five different configurations of high-porosity stents. Particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) measurements were obtained to validate the untreated velocity field. Six participants, totaling three CFD solvers, were provided with surface meshes of the vascular geometry and the deployed stent geometries, and flow rate boundary conditions for all inlets and outlets. As output, they were invited to submit an abstract to the 8th International Interdisciplinary Cerebrovascular Symposium 2011 (ICS’11), outlining their methods and giving their interpretation of the performance of each stent configuration. After the challenge, all CFD solutions were collected and analyzed. To quantitatively analyze the data, we calculated the root-mean-square error (RMSE) over uniformly distributed nodes on a plane slicing the main flow jet along its axis and normalized it with the maximum velocity on the slice of the untreated case (NRMSE). Good agreement was found between CFD and PIV with a NRMSE of 7.28%. Excellent agreement was found between CFD solutions, both untreated and treated. The maximum difference between any two groups (along a line perpendicular to the main flow jet) was 4.0 mm/s, i.e. 4.1% of the maximum velocity of the untreated case, and the average NRMSE was 0.47% (range 0.28–1.03%). In conclusion, given geometry and flow rates, research groups can accurately simulate the velocity field inside an intracranial aneurysm—as assessed by comparison with in vitro measurements—and find excellent agreement on the hemodynamic effect of different stent configurations. © 2014, Biomedical Engineering Society."

This paper introduces a new inverse lighting approach that uses the radiosity mean and variance to define lighting intentions of a scene. It is shown that these statistical parameters can be obtained without the previous calculation of the radiosity of the scene. Avoiding the explicit computation of the illumination of the scene results in a drastic reduction of the time required for the inverse process. This approach also provides a methodology that transforms a current set of lighting intentions into a single lighting intention with statistical parameters. The tests show that the processing time for solving the inverse problem can be reduced to a few seconds in most cases, improving previous work. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The characterization is specially suitable for state-feedback synthesis, and it further yields to the minimum number of linear functionals required to represent a stabilizing state-feedback mapping. It is furthermore proved that an upper bound for the aforementioned minimum number of linear functionals can be explicitly specified, and computed, in terms of a previously reported state-feedback exponential stabilizability condition.

The arterial wall elastic behavior is influenced by adventitial function; however, no studies were performed in order to elucidate if this layer plays a role in the changes determined by IABP. Our aim was to quantify acute IABP effects on the mechanical properties of muscular arteries in induced acute heart failure (AHF), before and after adventitia removal. Pressure and diameter were recorded in the iliac arteries (IA) of sheep (n=7), before and during 1:2 IABP: (i) in control state (CS) with intact IA, (ii) in CS after IA adventitia removal, and (iii) in de-adventitialized IA after AHF. Conduit function, compliance and arterial distensibility were calculated in each state. During CS, IABP resulted in intact IA dilatation and in an increase in conduit function, compliance and distensibility; adventitial removal determined an increase of arterial stiffness with respect to the CS, which decreased when IABP was used; the increase in arterial stiffness observed after adventitia removal was also detected in AHF state; IABP improves conduit function and arterial stiffness in de-adventitialized arteries, both before and during AHF. However, the improvement in these properties was lower than in intact arteries.

Experiments have been performed in transmission-reception mode, using two fixed ultrasonic transducers near the ends of the plate. Two different parameters of the time-reversed signal are used for monitoring the strain state, the peak amplitude and the focusing time. The inverse filter technique was used in the transmitted signal to equalize the amplitude spectrum, enhancing the sensitivity in the focus amplitude by 5 times. The external traction sensitivity was experimentally verified by using an aluminum plate (800 × 100 × 3 mm) and two 5-MHz ultrasonic transducers spaced 700 mm apart. At the maximum strain state (180 μstrain), the peak value was reduced by about 10% in the conventional process and by 50% using the inverse filter. To evaluate the effects of the strain in the time-reversal signal, a theoretical model was constructed. This model is successful in predicting the changes in the group delay and, consequently, the focusing time using a linear equation. This relationship can also be used to determine the strain level quantitatively. The experimental results show that the time-reversal signal technique can be used in practical monitoring of changes at the strain level in mechanical structures. © 1986-2012 IEEE."

Electrospun polymer fibers of polystyrene with smooth morphology (1.3 μm average diameter) were used as sorbent materials for the fabrication of miniaturized solid phase extraction devices. A microcolumn SPE device (10 mg of electrospun fibers packed in a 200 μL pipette tip) and a SPE disk device (10 mg of electrospun fibers packed in a 500 μL polypropylene barrel) were used.

The behavior at the interface was evaluated by equilibrium surface tension and surface rheological properties of adsorbed films. There were significant differences (α-≥-0.05) in the values of the constants of adsorption to the interface of the four proteins. The glycinin had the slowest rate of adsorption, due to its low average hydrophobicity, low molecular flexibility and large molecular size. Smaller proteins like β-lactoglobulin and α-lactoalbumin tended to greater equilibrium pressure values than the larger proteins because of its higher rate of adsorption to the interface. The foam capacity of proteins showed a positive correlation with the average hydrophobicity; the maximal retained liquid volume or the initial rate of passage of liquid to foam were significantly lower (α-≥-0.05) when protein was glycinin. The dilatational modulus of glycinin was the lowest, which implies lowest resistance to disruption of the film. Glycinin protein has lower proportion of gravitational drainage and higher disproportionation having perhaps a less resistant film. In conclusion, β-conglycinin and whey proteins showed a similar behavior, so β-conglycinin might be the best soybean protein to replace milk proteins in food formulations. © 2012 Author(s)."

This step is typically run at pH 3.0-3.5 at 90-95°C with a delay of 2 to 4 hours. In this study the target was to find out if similar or better results could be obtained at higher temperatures with a shorter delay. A commercial oxygen delignified eucalyptus kraft pulp was treated at pH 3.0-3.2 at 80, 100, 120 and 140°C for varying times. The decrease in kappa number could be modeled with a single component first order kinetics. The correlation between kappa number and 2-furoic acid content of the filtrates was significant (R2=0.9969). The difference UV-visible reflectance absorption spectra (Δ(k/s)) were similar shape showing mostly decrease in content of hexenuronic acid. At the harshest condition, the baseline of the difference spectra at &gt;270 nm was shifted upwards indicating partial degradation of lignin. UV Raman measurements showed that the residual aromatic (lignin) content of the pulp was reduced by one third under the most extreme conditions. Quite surprisingly, the selectivity of the treatment was almost independent of temperature. This study gives additional information for designing mild acid stages for eucalyptus kraft pulp bleaching lines. The treatment could be carried out at a temperature much higher than applied today without any significant loss in the quality of the pulp."

However, all of them are developed in aqueous media, where the reagent is unstable. In addition, its hygroscopic nature was difficults in any attempt to make precise quantifications. The present work compares three different methods, namely, voltammetric, titrimetric, and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in order to assess the purity of sodium borohydride, using an expired and a new sodium borohydride samples as references. Our results show that only the FTIR measurements provide a simple and semi-quantitative means to assess the purity of sodium borohydride due to the fact that it is the only one that measures the sample in the solid state. A comparison between the experimental data and theoretical calculation reveals the identification of the absorption bands at 1437 cm -1 of sodium metaborate and 2291 cm -1 of sodium borohydride which represent a good fingerprint for the qualitative assessment of the sample quality. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis considers abatement, monitoring and sanctioning costs, as well as perfect and imperfect information on the part of the regulator with regard to the polluters' abatement costs. Under perfect information we find that (a) the total-cost-effective design of a program based on standards is one in which the standards are firm specific and perfectly enforced, and (b) the total cost of an optimally designed program based on standards is lower than the total cost of an optimally designed transferable emission permits system, except under special conditions. This is true when it is optimum to induce perfect compliance and when it is not. Under imperfect information, nevertheless, it is only by implementing a system of tradable permits and perfectly enforcing it with a constant marginal penalty tied to the price of the permits, that the regulator can surmount the informational problem and at the same time minimize the total cost of the program with certainty. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

The standard measurement of the ICP is performed invasively by the perforation of the cranial scalp in the presence of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Measuring the ICP in a noninvasive way is relevant for a great number of pathologies where the invasive measurement represents a high risk. The method proposed in this paper uses the Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) and the Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity (CBFV) - which may be obtained by means of non-invasive methods - to estimate the ICP. A non-linear Support Vector Machine was used and reached a low error between the real ICP signal and the estimated one, allowing an on-line implementation of the ICP estimation, with an adequate temporal resolution. © 2010 IEEE."

However, since multiple TCP connections in one or many paths can serve a common user, we advocate in this paper a user-centric notion of fairness, which we formulate in the Network Utility Maximization (NUM) framework. In particular, we develop control laws for the number of connections identified with a certain user, which can include single-path, multipath or more general aggregates of flows, and prove convergence to the optimal resource allocation. This theory applies directly to the case of cooperative users. In the case where connections are generated exogenously by possibly noncooperative users, we develop admission control policies that ensure both network stability and user-centric fairness. ©2010 IEEE."

Tracers that accumulate and remain fixed proportional to regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) at the time of injection are used to obtain SPECT images of the brain activity during and between seizures. The most used technique for detecting the epileptogenic zone (EZ) is to threshold the co-registered and normalized subtraction of these two images. This method has proven to be very useful but has some disadvantages: result depends on the selected threshold and abundance of false detections. In this paper we propose an a-contrario algorithm for detecting regions of the brain with significant changes in the rCBF using two SPECT images. This new method arises from formal deduction and no arbitrary parameters are involved. Comparisons of both methodologies on six patients are presented. The proposed algorithm shows good results in all cases and is more robust than the thresholding method. © 2009 IEEE."

As an example, Latin America shows the largest de-aggregation factor of IP prefixes among all regional Internet registries, being proportionally the largest contributor to the growth and dynamics of the global BGP routing table. In this article we analyze the peculiarities of LA interdomain routing architecture, and provide up-to-date data about the combined effects of the multihoming and TE practices in the region. We observe that the Internet Research Task Force initiative on the separation of the address space into locators and identifiers can not only alleviate the growth and dynamics of the global routing table, but can also offer appealing TE opportunities for LA. We outline one of the solutions under discussion at the IRTF, the Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol, and examine its potential in terms of interdomain traffic management in the context of LA. The key advantage of LISP is its nondisruptive nature, but the existing proposals for its control plane have some problems that may hinder its possible deployment. In light of this, we introduce a promising control plane for LISP that can solve these issues, and at the same time has the potential to bridge the gap between intradomain and interdomain traffic management. © 2009 IEEE."

Whether circadian changes in arterial stiffness (AS) could be related to the circadian profile of CE remains to be investigated. As yet, there is no accepted way to measure circadian profiles or nocturnal-related and/or morning-related changes in cardiovascular variables. The aim of this study was to characterize the circadian pattern and day-night and nightday changes of AS in untreated hypertensive (HG) and healthy subjects (NG), using a recently developed non-symmetrical sixparameter double-logistic model. Methods: Seven hypertensive and seven normotensive subjects underwent 24 hour ambulatory recordings of blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and aorto-brachial pulse transit time (PTTab) and pulse transit velocity index (PTVab). PTTab and PTVab are inversely and directly related to AS, respectively. The circadian profile and transitional periods (day-night and night-day) were analyzed using a model described by a six-parameter double logistic equation. Conclusions: The model was adequate to characterize the circadian pattern of AS. We provide the first evidence that AS in humans follows an asymmetric circadian pattern and that this differs between NG and HG. In both NG and HG, AS had a circadian profile, with the highest levels in the night. HG showed larger levels of AS, larger BP variations and rate of change and minor changes in AS during transitional periods. © 2008 IEEE."

In a highly dynamic P2P topology, the frequent connections and disconnections of nodes are the main obstacle we face when trying to offer a high Quality-of-Experience (QoE) to clients. We first introduce the P2P network architecture where this node dynamics occurs. This architecture employs a multi-source streaming approach where the stream is decomposed into several flows sent by different peers to each client, including some level of redundancy, in order to cope with the fluctuations in network connectivity. Then, we present the GRASP-based algorithm developed in order to tackle the problem of maintaining connectivity in presence of node dynamics by periodically reassigning network connections; these assignments are performed so as to maximize the global expected QoE, calculated using the recently proposed PSQA methodology. Additionally, we provide a variation of the GRASPbased algorithm, based on the Random Neural Network model. Finally, we show the results obtained when these algorithms are applied to a case study based on real life data. © 2008 IEEE."

The loop-transfer function of the proposed model is compared with the loop-transfer function obtained from a switch model, simulated with the SIMetrix/SIMPLIS software tool. The advantage of the SIMPLIS software tool is that it can compute a periodic operation point and introduce perturbations, to obtain a small-signal transfer-function around the operation point.

However, the use of fuels arising from reformate processes significantly lowers the current efficiency because of anodic catalytic poison coming from adsorbed carbon monoxide (CO ad). In this work, the influence of the addition of hydrogen peroxide in the flow current is studied, considering the adsorption and electrochemical oxidation of carbon monoxide on carbon-supported Pt (20% Pt/Vulcan) and Pt:Ru (1:1, 20% Pt:Ru/Vulcan) catalysts in 2 M sulphuric acid. The investigation was conducted applying cyclic voltammetry and on-line differential electrochemical mass spectrometry. A series of experiments has been performed to investigate the influence of the temperature as well as the time of contact and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide. Oxidation of CO ad to carbon dioxide occurs at lower potentials in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, it is possible to remove ca. 70% of CO ad on Pt/C electrodes. On the other hand, for PtRu/C electrodes, similar charge values to those of Pt/C electrodes were obtained for the CO stripping, but the process occurs at more negative potentials. In this case, the effect of partial desorption for CO ad by interaction with hydrogen peroxide is added to the bifunctional mechanism usually considered for this alloy. © 2007 Springer-Verlag."

Twelve batches of plain stirred yogurt of a commercial brand were studied, acquired both from a manufacturing plant and three retail stores. Both vane method and penetration tests allowed the detection of changes in the firmness of yogurts, confirming that they could be useful in routine quality control to characterize the firmness of yogurt. The yield stress of samples from the manufacturing plant varied within a range of 250 Pa. This important variation was partially explained by variations in the final acidity during fermentation, showing the importance of a standardized production in order to obtain a uniform texture. The yield stress of yogurts from the manufacturing plant was significantly higher than that of samples from the different retail stores. Averaged values being considered, the yogurts lost 53 Pa of their original yield stress during distribution and handling inside retail stores, probably due to mechanical damage. This mechanical damage also caused the occurrence of syneresis. © 2006, Blackwell Publishing."

The data analysed are the multi-valued time series obtained from sampling the secondary velocity components at a fixed cross-section of the channel, over consecutive time steps. The mean values of the secondary flow motion velocities are one order of magnitude lower than their r.m.s values. The purpose of the conditional sampling scheme used is to replace the picture of the secondary flow motions provided by the unconditional time mean with several ensemble averages. In this way the whole variability of the instantaneous data can be split in two parts: one for the difference between the observed ensemble averages, and the other for the variability within each ensemble. Unlike other conditional sampling schemes which sort only part of the data into one or more families depending on an externally fixed condition, the fuzzy clustering approach used here first determines the optimum number of families or clusters and then classifies all the recorded time steps. The results show that the local turbulence intensities of the ensemble averages obtained from fuzzy clustering can be reduced by one order of magnitude. In addition, the classification of all the time steps into several clusters or families enables the large scale dynamics of the educed structures to be analysed. © 2005 Elsevier SAS.

Detectors were made with representative platelets by Pd or Au thermal deposition (contact areas of 0.03, 0.09, 0.12 cm2), Pd wire attachment with aquadag and acrylic encapsulation. TMZ crystals show a better surface crystal quality, but this fact does not seem to particularly influence the detector electrical properties. Nevertheless, the metal used for contact deposition determines the resistivity, and Au emerges as better than Pd for this purpose.

By putting such targets immediately under the free surface of water, the diffracted acoustical field can excite the surface membrane before evanesce, and it produces a static ripple because of the radiation pressure. A collimated beam of light reflects at the perturbed surface, and it becomes modulated in phase. In this work we show experimental results where we achieve an optical image of the acoustical evanescent waves produced by an array-like target. Arising from the theory, we present a numerical calculus of the optical image produced by the ultrasonic field diffracted from the target in order to verify the experimental results.

Of the large number of these external cavity modes (ECMs) created in pairs of modes and antimodes by moderate feedback, the antimodes are always unstable, while the modes may be stable or unstable when created. The ECMs that have a large positive frequency shift with respect to the emission frequency of the solitary laser are unstable when created. In contrast, the ECMs that have a large, negative frequency shift are stable on creation and remain stable over a relatively large feedback range. For sufficiently large feedback an ECM that is created stable gives way to a time-dependent solution (limit cycle or torus) that is localized in phase space around the ECM; several time-dependent attractors may coexist. Approximating the dynamical equations, taking into account terms up to second order, we obtain relations for the amplitudes of the oscillations of the laser variables for these attractors. The external cavity length and the injection current are key parameters which determine these amplitudes. Our approximations are in good agreement with numerical simulations, and hold even far from the bifurcation points where these attractors originate."

It enables the ability to obtain a high dynamic-range linear-in-dB characteristic with a small footprint. Digital assistance is used to correct for a nonlinear characteristic and to perform a self-calibration. In state-of-the-art CMOS RF systems-on-chip (SoCs), the digital capabilities required for this technique would not represent an overhead for the design, as they are already available. The self-calibration compensates for the process variability relying on internal dc measurements and statistical information derived from the statistical models provided by the foundry. This technique would benefit SoCs, which implement built-in self test or built-in self calibration by enabling multiple high dynamic-range internal RF measurements, while complying with tight area and power budgets. A proof-of-concept detector cell is presented in a 90-nm CMOS process, which provides a maximum linearity error of 1.5 dB and a 33-dB dynamic range at 2 GHz after digital correction. The circuit occupies an area of 0.004 mm2 and consumes a maximum of 240-μA from a 1.2-V supply. The results are confirmed by measurements performed on ten samples. © 2015 IEEE."

(2013), a new method based on the Laplace approximation was developed to accelerate the estimation of the post-experimental expected information gains (Kullback-Leibler divergence) in model parameters and predictive quantities of interest in the Bayesian framework. A closed-form asymptotic approximation of the inner integral and the order of the corresponding dominant error term were obtained in the cases where the parameters are determined by the experiment. In this work, we extend that method to the general case where the model parameters cannot be determined completely by the data from the proposed experiments. We carry out the Laplace approximations in the directions orthogonal to the null space of the Jacobian matrix of the data model with respect to the parameters, so that the information gain can be reduced to an integration against the marginal density of the transformed parameters that are not determined by the experiments. Furthermore, the expected information gain can be approximated by an integration over the prior, where the integrand is a function of the posterior covariance matrix projected over the aforementioned orthogonal directions. To deal with the issue of dimensionality in a complex problem, we use either Monte Carlo sampling or sparse quadratures for the integration over the prior probability density function, depending on the regularity of the integrand function. We demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the proposed method via several nonlinear under-determined test cases. They include the designs of the scalar parameter in a one dimensional cubic polynomial function with two unidentifiable parameters forming a linear manifold, and the boundary source locations for impedance tomography in a square domain, where the unknown parameter is the conductivity, which is represented as a random field. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

For structural applications lumber must be strength graded and the properties should be available for professionals and customers. This research was motivated by the lack of strength-graded lumber and a strength class system in Uruguay. The objective was to characterize Pinus elliottii and Pinus taeda timber and to assign strength grades. The study evaluated a representative sample of currently produced material in Uruguay, including lumber from a 25-year-old west and 15-year- old southern-west plantations. Approximately 900 structural pieces were graded in three qualitative grades, and then tested in bending, compression- and tensile- parallel to grain. For each grade, a group of strength properties was associated. Comparison with EN 338 strength classes and NCh 1198 indicated that the superior group comprised of 25-year-old timber could be assigned to C14 class, while none complied with NCh 1198 requirements. None of the 15 year-old groups attained the international structural requirements."

It is well known that SRAM power consumption can be reduced by employing a banked structure, where unused banks are switched into the low leakage retention mode. Although several power management strategies and algorithms for allocating the memory contents to the banks have been proposed, the energy savings limits of these techniques were not completely explored. In this work, we propose a new strategy for memory banking, taking advantage of the software properties intrinsic to WSN, and achieve aggressive power savings. We present a detailed model of the energy saving for uniform banks with two power management schemes: a best-oracle policy and a simple greedy policy. The model gives valuable insight into key factors (coming from the application, the technology, and design decisions) that are critical for reaching the maximum achievable energy saving. Using our model the optimum number of banks can be estimated at design time to reach more aggressive energy savings. The memory content allocation and the power management problem were solved by an integer linear program formulation for two real wireless sensor network applications (based on TinyOS and ContikiOS). Experimental results show memory energy reduction up to 78.3 % for a partition overhead of 1 %, representing an overall energy saving close to 19 % in data collection WSN applications, including the communication energy and sleep power. The saving would increase to 34 % in more intensive processing applications. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Images can be transmitted over a wireless sensor network in order to build the plague population database and to take appropriate countermeasures in case of infection. Wireless sensor networks are suitable to implement such application, however the technology is certainly conditioned by economic constraints and the tendency is to use low-cost commercial nodes with constrained hardware resources. When trying to build an application that involves acquisition, processing and transmission of images, it is often argued that commercial available nodes can not fulfill the application specifications. Reported approaches to tackle the problem are to design ad-hoc high-performance nodes by using enhanced hardware resources, clearly superior to those of commercial nodes. It increases the cost against the WSN philosophy (i.e. low-cost nodes and constrained hardware resources usage). Contrary to the established, this article shows the achieved design of a low-cost wireless image-sensor nodes that incorporate image handling capabilities with constrained hardware resources.

The equivalence ratio of the combustible mixture is changed from 0.7 to 0.9 and 1.0, i.e.; from very lean to stoichiometric. Ethanol is added in the volumetric proportions of 5-25 %. For each equivalence ratio and for each ethanol fraction added, we calculate the coefficient of variation (COV) of the heat release time series. From the values of COV, we find that at a fixed equivalence ratio, the CCV of heat release decreases as the amount of ethanol addition is increased. We also find that for a fixed volume fraction of ethanol, the CCV increases with leaner mixtures. In addition, we use a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to analyze the heat release time series. From the CWT, the dominant modes of the CCV are identified and the engine cycles over which these modes may persist are delineated. The results reveal that the CCV of heat release occur on multiple timescales and exhibit complex dynamics. With no ethanol added, high-frequency intermittent fluctuations together with more persistent low-frequency variations are observed. As the volume fraction of ethanol is increased, the low-frequency variations tend to become less persistent and more intermittent. Furthermore, at a fixed equivalence ratio, when ethanol fraction is increased, the overall spectral power is found to decrease significantly indicating that ethanol has a pronounced effect on reducing the CCV. An advantage of using a simulated model engine is that the computations can be easily carried out to a large number of cycles and thus determine the long term dynamics of the cyclic variations. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

In this context, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the influence of steam distillation on the sensory and physicochemical characteristics of extracts of five native Uruguayan plants (Acca sellowiana, Achyrocline satureioides, Aloysia gratisima, Baccharis trimera and Mikania guaco). Aqueous extracts from the five native plants were obtained. Steam distillation was used to produce two types of deodorized extracts: extracts from deodorized leaves and extracts deodorized after the extraction. The extracts were characterized in terms of their total polyphenolic content and antioxidant activity (using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl- hydrazyl and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid methods). A trained assessor panel evaluated characteristic odour, characteristic flavour, bitterness and astringency of the extracts. The total polyphenolic content of the extracts ranged from 112.4 to 974.4 mg/100 mL, whereas their antioxidant capacity ranged from 9.6 to 1008.7 mg vitamin C equivalents/100 mL, depending on the type of extract and the method being considered. Steam distillation was effective in reducing the characteristic odour and flavour of the extracts, without causing large changes in their polyphenolic content and antioxidant activity. In general, in terms of sensory characteristics, steam distillation performed on the extracts gave better results than when performed on the leaves; whereas the opposite trend was found for polyphenolic content and antioxidant activity. Results suggested that steam distillation could be a promising low-cost procedure for the production of antioxidant extracts for food products. © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav."

It is not difficult to demonstrate that the proposed setup produces a resultant image with very pronounced dark contours at middle intensity. After the optical preprocessing, two different digital algorithms are applied: an edge linking algorithm (modified chain code) and a simple thresholding technique for image segmentation.

The studies and experiments focus on goal-oriented navigation where both rats and robots exploit distal cues to localize and find a goal in an open environment. The task involves training of both rats and robots to find the shortest path to the goal from multiple starting points in the environment. The spatial cognition model is based on the rat's brain neurophysiology of the hippocampus extending previous work by analyzing granularity of localization in relation to a varying number and position of landmarks. The robot integrates internal and external information to create a topological map of the environment and to generate shortest routes to the goal through path integration. One of the critical challenges for the robot is to analyze the similarity of positions and distinguish among different locations using visual cues and previous paths followed to reach the current position.

The possibility of identifying early subclinical endothelial damage during pregnancy could be of value in classifying the different hypertensive states of pregnancy, and have a positive impact in the understanding of this syndrome, as well as on the appropriate treatment of these patients. Reactive hyperemia-related changes in carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (PWVcr) were proposed as an alternative tool for the evaluation of EF in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. If impaired EF, which follows hypertensive disorders of pregnancy can be assessed using PWVcr changes remains still unknown. Aims: To assess and compare reactive hyperemia-related changes in PWVcr and FMD in pregnant women (healthy and with hypertensive disorders) and non pregnant women. Methods: Healthy pregnant (HP; n=13), preeclamptic (PE; n=7), non-proteinuric hypertensive (NPH; n=6) and non-pregnant (NP; n=32) women were included. Left PWVcr (strain gauge mechano-transducers), left brachial arterial diameter (B-Mode ultrasound) and blood flow velocity (Doppler ultrasound) were measured before (baseline) and after the transient ischemia of the left forearm were determined. Results: One minute after the cuff deflation, PWVcr decreased in HP (6.9 ± 1.5 to 6.0 ± 0.9 m/s, p&#60;0.001) and in NP (8.1 ± 0.9 to 7.4 ± 0.9 m/s; p&#60;0.001). NPH showed a blunted hyperemic PWVcr response (6.6 ± 1.4 to 6.7 ± 1.0 m/s; p=0.91), whereas PE showed a tendency to increase (6.0 ± 0.7 to 6.4 ± 0.8 m/s; p=0.10). Reactive hyperemia PWVcr response (ΔPWVcr in %) differed comparing HP with NPH (12% vs. +2%; p&#60;0.01) and with PE (12 vs. +6%; p &#60;0.01), whereas no differences were found between NHP and PE (p=1.00). Conclusion: HP showed an enhanced PWVcr reduction, whereas PE and NPH showed a blunted hyperemic PWVcr response. Carotid-radial PWVcr analysis could have a potential role in the assessment of pregnancy to study EF with a potential clinical application in predicting pregnancy induced hypertension and preeclampsia. © 2012 IEEE."

Simulations are performed at a wave Reynolds number Rew = UmaxA/ν = 1.41 × 106 in the turbulent regime. The computed statistics are compared with great success with the available experimental results reported in the literature for Umax = 1.02 m/s the maximum orbital velocity, A = 1.58 m the amplitude of the water excursion, and ν = 1.14 × 106 m2/s the kinematic viscosity of the fluid (Rew = UmaxA/ν = 1.41 × 106). The simulation results allow to identify the development of an unsteady shear layer and regions of zero and negative turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) production. The TKE balance is studied in detail, analyzing the role of each of the terms in the balance equation and the relative relevance of different TKE transport mechanisms. It is found that the local derivative of the TKE is particularly important in the shear layer region. The present results provide an accurate and detailed dataset that could be used for validation of both analytical and numerical models of oscillatory boundary layer flows. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis."

However, the sensitivity of reconfigurable FPGAs to ionizing radiation mandates the adoption of fault tolerant mitigation techniques that may impact heavily the FPGA resource usage. In this paper we consider time redundancy, that allows avoiding the high overhead that more traditional approaches like N-modular redundancy introduce, at an affordable cost in terms of application execution-time overhead. A single processor executes two instances of the same software sequentially; the two instances are segregated in their own memory space through a soft IP core that monitors the processor/memory interface for any violations. Moreover, the IP core checks for any processor functional interruption by means of a watchdog timer.

This paper presents an investigation of a controlled separation of the Uruguayan network into two stable islands, using power swing blocking (PSB) and out-of-step tripping (OST) protection functions. The investigation is based on transient stability studies using comprehensive models and, on the role of PSB and OST covering many possible protection strategies. The study specifically compares the amount of load shedding necessary to achieve similar transient performance with and without a controlled islanding scheme. The results show first that the required load shedding is relatively high (about 500 MVA), and that the controlled islanding scheme allows similar transient performance with 20% saving of load curtailment. ©2010 IEEE."

Therefore, a major challenge is the design of efficient low-noise circuits. These amplifiers work at low frequency ranging from sub-Hz to few kHz, thus besides the presence of thermal (white) noise, flicker noise (1/f noise) can be the largest. Autozero technique is used to reduce offset and flicker noise. However, a main issue in this kind of amplifiers is the aliasing of white noise inherit to the switching process, which increases the noise floor at low frequencies. In this work, the design of a low-noise amplifier for electroencephalography (EEG) signal recording is presented. The Autozero technique is applied to an instrumentation amplifier in the range of biological signals, with the addition of a low-pass filter in the noise cancellation feedback with the objective of reducing the impact of aliasing.

When the offered load is less than capacity, stochastic stability of networks using such policies has been established for exponentially distributed file sizes. The problem has remained open for general file size distributions, which is very relevant as it is well known that Internet file sizes follow heavy-tailed distributions. In this paper, building on existing results on the fluid model of the system, we use a partial differential equation to characterize the dynamics. The equation keeps track of residual file size and therefore is suitable to study networks under general file size distributions.

The system uses the fact that periodic structures under coherent illumination generate replicas of itself displaced half period at certain distances (1/2-Talbot's length). Projecting back this displaced self-image onto the mask creates a suppression of the periodic structure. If the mask presents defects, the cancellation of the periodic structure allows their detection since the self-imaging phenomenon occurs only for the periodic structure.

The quality of all samples was checked by X-ray diffraction and scanning electronic microscopy while their physical properties were verified by transport and magnetic measurements. The elastic study was performed using the standard pulse-echo technique through measuring the phase velocity and the attenuation of ultrasonic waves (in the range of a few MHz) as a function of temperature. We have focused this study on the low temperatures interval (T &lt; 200 K). The obtained results show a strong hysteretic behavior in the ultrasonic attenuation (in addition to usually observed hysteretic behavior for the velocity) which strongly supports the existence of a martensitic-like phase above the superconducting critical temperature Tc. We argue that this peculiar behavior can be attributed to the granularity present in the samples. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In other words we aim for a mechanism with setup times as shorter as those realizable by Control Plane signalling and with Traffic Engineering capabilities as powerful as in management systems. The concept has been prototyped and initial tests have been performed in a simulated network environment. The outcome of these tests show that our system can be nearly as fast as conventional Control Plane setup mechanisms and by construction it can take advantage of all the network information got by the Management Plane for Constrained-Based Routing (CBR) purposes. Therefore, a trade-off between speed and resource optimisation is feasible.

Furthermore, measured chronaxies increase with the distance between the electrode and the fiber. A mathematical formula that relates the time constant of the strength duration curve with the parameters of the system composed by the electrode, the volume conductor and the fiber is used to explain the aforementioned differences for unmyelinated nerve and skeletal muscle fibers. For both extacellular and intracellular electrodes, the time constant is an increasing function of a characteristic length. This length is obtained from a relation between the unstable stationary solutions of Nagumo's nonlinear cable equation and the polarizing effect of the electrodes on the fiber. In the case of extracellular electrodes, the characteristic length is defined as the measure of an interval of influence constructed from the activating function. In the case of point intracellular electrodes,the characteristic length is defined by a construction done with the help of the only bounded but not constant stationary solution of Nagumo's equation. © 2005 IEEE."

A final analysis concludes that SP-association of transistors allows to build very efficient transconductors, for demanding applications in the field of implantable electronics among others.

The growth was performed in a system especially designed and constructed for getting a fine control of the growth parameters. The best growth conditions were a source temperature of 120°C, a growth temperature of 60°C and a growth time of 48 hours, with an initial pressure of 6 × 10-3 Pa. Film thicknesses and grain sizes gave values ranging between 100 and 260 μm (10%), and between 10 and 30 μm, respectively. Films grow oriented with the (0 0 l) crystalline planes parallel to the substrate, with a texture of 0.94, measured by X-ray powder diffraction. The dark current density of the films is lower than 0.3 pA/mm2 for electric fields below 0.4 V/μm, and their resistivity is 1.5 × 1014 Ω.cm. Mobility-lifetime values of 2 × 10-5 cm2/V and 5 × 10-5 cm2/V can be estimated for electrons and holes respectively. Films give a sensitivity to X-rays of 37 nC/R.cm2. A signal to dark relation of 1120 was measured at 750 mR/s and 32 KVp, with an electric field of 0.4 V/μm applied to the film. The low dark current, as far as the high signal to noise results obtained, are attributed to the high texture of the films and to the charge transport along the c axis. © 2004 IEEE."

Bismuth tri-iodide synthesized from bismuth subcarbonate and potassium iodide was used as starting material Sample composition was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction. A first set of samples (at 400 imnHg of Ar) was purified by zone refining in a vertical zone refining furnace at 460 °C and at a speed of about 3 cm/hr down the length of the ingot, 100 passes. One of these samples was then purified by sublimation. A second set of samples was purified by repeated sublimation under Ar atmosphere (400 mniHg) with the source sample at 370 °C and the cold extreme of the ampoule at room temperature. The starting and purified products' stoichiometry was determined. Also the starting and purified materials purity was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Zone refining appears as an appropriate method for purification of several impurities, while sublimation, for others. On the other hand, zone refining crearly deteriorates the material stoichiometry (from BiI2.82 to BiI2.75), while a combination of the two methods, that is, a first zone refining process of about 100 passes, followed by, at least, one sublimation, results to be the most appropriate purification method, in order of obtaining a pure but also stroichiometric material (BiI3.08). This process has a yield of 20%. The purification way proposed here turns over to be the same what was found for lead iodide purification, although easier, because of the lower tendency to bismuth tri-iodide to decompose."

All parameters specified as programmable can be changed in a noninvasive manner (using a programming interface wand connected to a computer using the Windows 95/98 environment). Two new functions may be very useful clinically, based on experimental research. 1. Work-rest regimen. The LD-PACE II is able to deliver alternating periods of muscle contractions and rest. Work and rest periods may be programmed independently between 1 and 120 minutes in increments of 1 minute. The work-test regimen may be useful clinically if muscle contractions are needed for cardiac assist postoperatively. 2. Night/day regimen. This feature allows for a change in the ratio of muscle contractions according to a patient's activity level. During the day the cardiosynchronization ratio may be set from 1:1 to 1:4, and during the night it may be set for 1:8 to 1:16. This allows the muscle to have a long rest period, prevents overuse, and prolongs battery life. These two new features make this cardiomyostimulator very attractive for cardiomyoplasty in particular.

The JPS is in principle a bidimensional image. The second step is the calculation of the cross-correlation function. To do this, the JPS image is compressed to one dimension and a 1-D Fourier transform is performed. This significantly reduces the number of operations required to evaluate the cross-correlation.

This work investigates the relevance of the stiffness, impedance and attenuation coefficient of the polymer in the lateral vibration modes. Circular plates of 1-3 composites of PZT+1 wt% Nb/polymer have been prepared with a ceramic square rod geometry and to volume fraction around 34%.

At the micro and mini hydropower assessment, the main role was placed on the census of potential users and the preliminary analysis of the representative places for the different technical solutions adequate to the variety of topographic conditions and load requirements. For power above 1 MW and up to 5 MW, the generating potential was assessed all over the country. If power lower than 1 MW or lower than 100kW (mini and micro) is considered, the information available in maps with contour lines, including in those of a 1:50.000 scale, is not enough to identify the most adequate places. Instead, knowledge of the place is indispensable in these cases. A preliminary plan of several installations was worked out."

There is a growing consensus that spike timing or latency coding can maximally exploit the timing of neural events to make fast computing elements and that such mechanisms are essential to information processing functions in the brain. The electric sense of mormyrid fish provides a convenient biological model where this coding scheme can be studied. The sensory input is a physically ordered spatial pattern of current densities, which is coded in the precise timing of primary afferent spikes. The neural circuits of the processing pathway are well known and the system exhibits the best known illustration of corollary discharge, which provides the reference to decoding the sensory afferent latency pattern. A theoretical model has been constructed from available electrophysiological and neuroanatomical data to integrate the principal traits of the neural processing structure and to study sensory interaction with motor-command-driven corollary discharge signals. This has been used to explore neural coding strategies at successive stages in the network and to examine the simulated network capacity to reproduce output neuron responses. The model shows that the network has the ability to resolve primary afferent spike timing differences in the sub-millisecond range, and that this depends on the coincidence of sensory and corollary discharge-driven gating signals. In the integrative and output stages of the network, corollary discharge sets up a proactive background filter, providing temporally structured excitation and inhibition within the network whose balance is then modulated locally by sensory input. This complements the initial gating mechanism and contributes to amplification of the input pattern of latencies, conferring network hyperacuity. These mechanisms give the system a robust capacity to extract behaviorally meaningful features of the electric image with high sensitivity over a broad working range. Since the network largely depends on spike timing, we finally discuss its suitability for implementation in robotic applications based on neuromorphic hardware. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd."

The cyclic variability is a well-known phenomenon in this kind of engines, especially when operating at lean conditions. It can affect engine stability and efficiency to a great extent. Among its main causes is the development of turbulent combustion in each cycle, which is associated with turbulent flow during admission. On the other hand, hydrogen is a fuel known by its elevated laminar flame speed, which is in principle interesting to increase the rate of combustion, and so decrease cyclic variability effects. Our group has developed a quasi-dimensional numerical engine model that incorporates cycle-to-cycle variability. In the present work, the effect of hydrogen addition is considered in the model. Wrinkled flame effects are taken into account by introducing a linear factor in the flame front area dependent on the amount of hydrogen in the fuel. The model is validated by direct comparison with experimental results. Studying the coefficient of variation of power output time series, it is concluded that for lean mixtures, when the percentage of hydrogen increases, cyclic variability decreases up to a minimum value, which depends on the fuel-air equivalence ratio. Minimum values of cyclic variability amplitude are observed at fuel ratios near 0.9 and 70% percentage of hydrogen in fuel by volume."

This loss is particularly significant when MOS gate or deep trench capacitors are used. We propose a technique for top/bottom-plate charge recycling that can be applied with low overhead independently of the converter architecture. Two examples of application of the technique are presented. First, it is shown how the technique can be applied to any converter by transforming it to an interleaved implementation. This approach is demonstrated in a series-parallel 1/3 down converter achieving a maximum load power of 240 μ W. Simulation results show an improvement of 7% in the efficiency by decreasing the top/bottom-plate parasitic capacitance losses by 52%. The second example considers an architecture where the proposed technique can be directly applied without additional transformations of the converter implementation. It is a ring modular architecture converter, which was fabricated in a 130 nm CMOS process.

This is because of the difficulty of measuring the removing flows correctly because they are highly variable in both time and space. To help solve this problem, a mathematical algorithm, the so-called canal monitoring algorithm, which determines the history of lateral extractions, is propounded. It uses the water depth measurements at checkpoints and the gate and other control device trajectories, which are implemented on the canal during a past period of time, and then obtains water withdrawals that happened at the outlets. The method also gives an estimation of the current state of the canal for model predictive control purposes. The algorithm solves the classical inverse problem, in which the unknowns are the parameters that define the flow rate trajectories of canal outlets, which are defined as piecewise functions of time in this paper. The algorithm is on the basis of the Gauss-Newton method and uses the complete Saint-Venant equations for the computation of the least-squared function. Numerical tests with excellent results have highlighted its computational efficiency, converging in a few iterations to the exact final results. These properties make the algorithm adequate to operate in real time. A laboratory canal test for verification shows accuracy in detecting water withdrawals at canal outlets when the Manning roughness coefficients are known. The test also reveals a functional relationship between the discharge removed and the empirical coefficients. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Once implemented, the method only requires the experimental data (impedance modulus and phase data acquired by an impedometer), material density, geometry, and initial values for the properties. This method combines a FEM routine implemented using an 8-noded axisymmetric element with a gradient-based optimization routine based on the method of moving asymptotes (MMA). The main objective of the optimization procedure is minimizing the quadratic difference between the experimental and numerical electrical conductance and resistance curves (to consider resonance and antiresonance frequencies). To assure the convergence of the optimization procedure, this work proposes restarting the optimization loop whenever the procedure ends in an undesired or an unfeasible solution. Two experimental examples using PZ27 and APC850 samples are presented to test the precision of the method and to check the dependency of the frequency range used, respectively. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd."

These programs must exercise the different parts of the system, and produce a behavior different than the normal one in case of faults. However, their effectiveness depends on the adopted observation mechanism, which is deeply affected by the constraints imposed by the in-field application environment. This paper first describes different mechanisms for supporting the observation of possible fault effects; then, it reports and discusses the results of an experimental analysis performed on a multicore system, based on a representative pipelined processor.

The effect of molybdenum substitution was analyzed by potential, composition, and temperature (E-c-T) and charge/discharge curves. Hysteresis values and the potential between charge/discharge curves have been used as parameters for efficiency loss. Further, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out in order to visualize the charge transfer and diffusion component during activation process. A mathematical approach is presented here based on the mechanism involved in the course of the hydriding reaction solving a spherical second Fick’s law. Thus, adsorbed hydrogen is considered to be transferred from the surface to inner sites, and the diffusion into the bulk of the alloy is demonstrated to be the slow route. Diffusion overpotentials and time constants for AB5 alloys were calculated as a function of the number of hydrogenation cycles. These results show that the molybdenum content has positive effects in kinetic behavior. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

In this paper we compute the leading electroweak and QCD contributions to the top VR coupling in the standard model. This value is the starting point in order to separate the standard model effects and, then, search for new physics. We also propose observables that can be addressed at the LHC in order to measure this coupling.

However, it is very sensitive to process variability which can impact the robustness and effective performance of the circuit. On the other hand, this sensitivity decreases toward near-threshold operation. In this paper, the impact of variability on sub-threshold and near-threshold circuit performance is investigated through analytical modeling and circuit simulation in a 65 nm industrial low power CMOS process. It is shown that variability moves the effective minimum energy point toward the near-threshold region. Also, when variability is taken into account, a complete model including the region near-threshold (moderate inversion) is required to correctly model circuit performance around the minimum energy point. An analytical solution for the optimum supply voltage that minimizes the total energy per operation, while considering variability effects, is provided. Additionally, the resulting speed-consumption trade-off in a variability aware analysis of sub-threshold and near-threshold operation is presented. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

SiNWs were synthesized by self-assembly electroless metal deposition nanoelectrochemistry in an ionic silver HF solution through selective etching. Total reflectance (Rt) and total diffuse reflectance (Rdt) of SiNWs change drastically in comparison to polished Si. To understand these changes, diffuse reflectance (Rd) with polarized incident light was studied. For samples prepared on Si(111), the wave length integrated Rd (wIRd) shows maxima at certain angles of incidence θ, regardless of the incident light polarization. For samples prepared on Si(100), wIRd increases with θ and depends on incident light polarization. Also, Rd spectra show structures due to interference effects.

The plant hormone ethylene has been described either to protect or potentiate chilling injury development in citrus whereas little is known about transcriptional regulation of ethylene biosynthesis, perception and response during cold storage and how the hormone is regulating its own perception and signaling cascade. Then, the objective of the present study was to explore the transcriptional changes in the expression of ethylene biosynthesis, receptors and response genes during cold storage of the white Marsh and the red Star Ruby grapefruits. The effect of the ethylene action inhibitor, 1-MCP, was evaluated to investigate the involvement of ethylene in the regulation of the genes of its own biosynthesis and perception pathway. Ethylene production was very low at the harvest time in fruits of both varieties and experienced only minor changes during storage. By contrast, inhibition of ethylene perception by 1-MCP markedly induced ethylene production, and this increase was highly stimulated during shelf-life at 20 °C, as well as transcription of ACS and ACO. These results support the autoinhibitory regulation of ethylene in grapefruits, which acts mainly at the transcriptional level of ACS and ACO genes. Moreover, ethylene receptor1 and ethylene receptor3 were induced by cold while no clear role of ethylene was observed in the induction of ethylene receptors. However, ethylene appears to be implicated in the transcriptional regulation of ERFs both under cold storage and shelf-life. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions."

In the present work, quantitative shear elasticity imaging from a complex elastic wavefield is demonstrated in soft solids. By correlating the elastic field at different positions, which can be interpreted as a time-reversal experiment, shear waves are virtually focused on any point of the imaging plane. According to the Rayleigh criterion, the focus size is directly related to the shear wave speed and thus to the shear elasticity. To locally retrieve a shear wave speed estimation, analytical and empirical expressions that relate the focus size with the shear wave speed and the frequency band used in the correlation computation are derived. The validity of such expressions is demonstrated numerically and experimentally on a tissue-mimicking phantom consisting of two different elastic layers. The obtained results were in complete agreement with a prior shear wave speed estimation demonstrating the potential of the technique to quantitative shear elasticity assessment using a complex elastic wavefield.

A switched positive linear system is proved to be state-feedback exponentially stabilisable if and only if there is a set of Lagrange multipliers whose image, via a linear mapping of the system's modes, is a Schur matrix. This characterisation directly leads to a simple and novel method for the synthesis of exponentially stabilising state-feedback mappings. A particular set of Lagrange multipliers is explicitly obtained as the result of constructively establishing an upper bound on the minimum number of Lagrange multipliers required to attain (through the aforementioned linear mapping) a Schur matrix. This construction of a particular set of Lagrange multipliers can always be used to complete the first step of the obtained synthesis method. It is further shown that for a (stabilisable) switched positive linear system with rank-one modes, the number of modes that constitute the system is an upper bound on the minimum number of Lagrange multipliers required to generate a Schur matrix, as well as an upper bound on the minimum number of linear functionals required to represent an exponentially stabilising state-feedback mapping.

When the DOA of the desired signal is near to the sector edge, the SINR is significantly degraded because of less effectiveness in the interference mitigation algorithm. A quantitative estimation of this degradation is provided in this work. Some possible solutions to cope with this situation are discussed, and also some design criteria are provided."

The key feature to be exploited is load deferrability in time, which enables the aggregator to adapt the consumption profile and thus reduce its own consumption of regulation, and even be a provider of regulation services to others. Rather than a microscopic model that considers individual loads and their scheduling, we consider here a macroscopic viewpoint drawn from fluid models of queueing systems. Here the state variable is the quantity of currently dispatchable loads, and the control input dictates the fraction of those which are currently active. The dynamics is a simple nonlinear ODE that allows us to design a controller with a feedforward term to track an external regulation reference, and a feedback term to reduce the impact of random load oscillations, in an agnostic way to the microscopic scheduling. The performance of this controller is evaluated by simulation using practical regulation signals. © 2015 American Automatic Control Council."

The biomechanical characterization of native vessels provides valuable information towards the development of synthetic grafts. Materials and Methods: Five samples of electrospun nanofibrous poly(L-lactic acid)(PLLA) tubular structures were subjected to physiological pulsating pressure using an experimental setup. Four ovine femoral arteries were also tested in the experimental setup under the same conditions. Instantaneous diameter and pressure signals were obtained using gold standard techniques, in order to estimate the dynamic pressure-strain elastic modulus (E<inf>Pε</inf>) of both native vessels and grafts. Results: Synthetic grafts showed a significant increase of E<inf>Pε</inf> (10.57±0.97 to 17.63±2.61 106 dyn/cm2) when pressure was increased from a range of 50-90 mmHg (elastin-response range) to a range of 100-130 mmHg (collagen-response range). Furthermore, femoral arteries also exhibited a significant increase of E<inf>Pε</inf> (1.66±0.30 to 15.76±4.78 106 dyn/cm2) with the same pressure variation, showing that both native vessels and synthetic grafts have a similar behavior in the collagen-acting range. Conclusion: The mechanical behavior of PLLA vascular grafts was characterized In vitro.

Uruguay is, through the Plan Ceibal, the first country to provide every public primary school child with a laptop free of charge. The Plan represents a major investment to promote digital literacy and improve the quality of education.Design/methodology/approach – Empirical data are drawn from a multiple case study of five public primary schools. Particular attention is given to how school facilities and their immediate surroundings mediate the successful introduction and adoption of individual laptops.Findings – Plan Ceibal has the potential to change traditional teaching methods and behavioural patterns, which will in turn have an impact on how facilities and spaces are used. Questions are raised regarding the ultimate effectiveness of the initiative and if the aspired to improvements might be curtailed by a lack of investment in other areas, such as the school infrastructure. We argue for a context-sensitive view on research that not only considers the technology and potential changes in pedagogical approaches but also the physical environment in which these changes are to take place.Originality/value – Research into facilities and asset management has an important role to play in the achievement of effective learning environments and the successful uptake of information communication technology (ICT) initiatives. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The sensor is composed by a strip of aluminum plate with two ultrasonic piezocomposite transducers bonded at the ends of the plate. The time reversal technique acts as a dispersion compensator of the guided waves propagating in the plate, allowing time recompression of the waves. When the plate is subjected to a longitudinal traction, a time reversal focusing is performed between the transducers in order to detect the change in the focus due to strain. The strain can be evaluated by measuring the change of the amplitude and shift in the time of flight, and comparing them with a reference signal obtained at zero strain state. In order to improve the systems sensitivity, 2-2 piezocomposite transducers designed to operate between 0.2 to 3.0 MHz are used. Experiments are conducted by applying strain up to 150 μ-strain. The results show an increase in sensitivity when compared with the results of the conventional mono-element transducer greater than 200%.

The overall system can be quickly isolated in the case of an emergency by closing the upstream pool. Transients, in which the initial state is hydraulically far from the final state, are difficult to handle and cannot be made in only one gate movement in order to protect the canal lining. Therefore, they have to be as smooth as possible. GoRoSo is a feedforward control algorithm for irrigation canals based on sequential quadratic programming. With this tool, it is possible to calculate the gate trajectories that smoothly carry the canal from the initial state to the final state by keeping the water depth constant at checkpoints.

But, to obtain a non-invasive estimation of these parameters on internal tissues, currently presents many difficulties that must be overcome. The use of high-frequency ultrasonic systems appears to offer a possible solution. In fact, the application of conventional ultrasonic imaging has shown this, but the spatial resolution related to this commercial option is not sufficient for a thickness evaluation with sufficient clinical significance, which would require accuracies of few microns. In this paper, some preliminary results of applying a new broadband ultrasonic procedure, recently developed by the authors for thickness measurement purposes, are analyzed for sub-millimeter layers made of materials similar (phantoms) to that of the biological tissues to be encountered into the artery walls. Two optional algorithms for estimating the power spectral density of the multi-pulse signals are assessed with some experimental echoes. Their potential resolutions and capabilities to provide accuracies around a micron are comparatively analyzed, for walls thickness estimation. © 2013 IEEE."

In this work, an empirical model to predict lateral pressure for vibrated concrete was developed. A total of 226 experimental data recompiled from the literature were used in the formulation of the model. The model considers seven of the variables that affect fresh concrete lateral pressure: placement rate, slump cone, the height of the concrete piece, concrete temperature, minimum form dimension and cross section size. Due to the formulation of the model, the prediction obtained is always lower than the hydrostatic distribution. The principal objective of the model is to have an accurate prediction for high placement rates (over 10 m/h), which is a common practice today. Based on this idea, experimental data for self-compacting concrete compiled from the literature were used to verify the model's accuracy. The results show that, in general, applying the proposed model produces predictions that are better than those obtained from preexisting models. In particular, for high placement rates the model presents a very good approximation to the experimental data. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

In this paper the authors introduce design constraint systems (DCS), their approach to the generation of architectural design with the help of a simple example: The development of the necessary formalisms to generate a family of architectural designs, i.e. simple houses and pagodas. After explaining the formal system the authors introduce an approach for the generation of complex form based on the application of transformations and distortions.Architecture is bound by the constraints of physical reality: Gravitation and the properties of the used materials define the limits in which architectural design is possible. With the recent development of new materials and construction methods however, the ways in which form and physics go together get more complicated. As a result, the shapes of architecture gain more liberty, and more and more complex shapes and structures become possible. While these advances allow for new ways of architectural expression, they also make the design process much more challenging. For this reason new tools are necessary for making this complexity manageable for the architect and enable her to play and experiment with the new possibilities of complex shapes and structures. Design constraint systems can be used as tool for experimentation with complex form. Therefore, the authors dedicate the final part of this paper to a concise delineation of an approach for the generation of complex and irregular shapes and structures.While the examples used are simple, they give an idea of the generality of design constraint systems: By using a two-component approach to the generation of designs (the first component describes the abstract structure of the modelled objects while the second component interprets the structure and generates the actual geometric forms) and allowing the user to adjust both components freely, it can be adapted to all kind of different architectural styles, from historical to contemporary architecture."

Instead of using water surface measurements obtained with a series of wave gages, we used water velocity measurements inside the water column obtained with an Ultrasonic Velocity Profiler to decompose the wave field. The technique allows for the identification of the incident and reflected first harmonic waves and the incident and reflected free and bound second harmonic waves. Only velocity measurements over a small fraction of the first harmonic wavelength are necessary to obtain reliable results, making the method suitable for studies where the water depth is not constant. Wave measurements obtained in a wave flume using four wave gages and three levels of wave reflection are used to evaluate the new method with excellent results. Finally, since no calibration of the velocity profiler is necessary, it is foreseen that the method could be implemented in a stand-alone instrument that would give the user the wave field decomposition without the need of a case by case set-up and calibration. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."

To avoid combinatoric difficulties, as well as to enable new peer exploration, we use a Gibbs sampler approach, in which a Markov chain is designed with stationary distribution determined by our energy function.

The model integrates allothetic (external visual landmarks) and idiothetic (internal kinesthetic information) cues to train either rat or robot to learn a path enabling it to reach a goal from multiple starting positions. It stands in contrast to most robotic architectures based on SLAM, where a map of the environment is built to provide probabilistic localization information computed from robot odometry and landmark perception. Allothetic cues suffer in general from perceptual ambiguity when trying to distinguish between places with equivalent visual patterns, while idiothetic cues suffer from imprecise motions and limited memory recalls. We experiment with both types of cues in different maze configurations by training rats and robots to find the goal starting from a fixed location, and then testing them to reach the same target from new starting locations. We show that the robot, after having pre-explored a maze, can find a goal with improved efficiency, and is able to (1) learn the correct route to reach the goal, (2) recognize places already visited, and (3) exploit allothetic and idiothetic cues to improve on its performance. We finally contrast our biologically-inspired approach to more traditional robotic approaches and discuss current work in progress. © 2012 SPIE."

Conclusions: We consider that the theoretical results obtained in this paper contribute to a deeper knowledge of the characteristics of the ELSR optimal solutions.

Parameters like perceived quality associated with delay times or costs per link usage are usually better expressed via several discrete categories (e.g. service levels ranging from 'poor' or even 'useless' to 'excellent'). The classical reliability model assigns the network a binary state based on connectedness of a given set of distinguished nodes. A vast literature exists for computing and estimating the reliability defined as the expected value of the binary structure function associated with such states. Recent research has also considered diameter constraints yet keeping the binary character of the network state. This paper introduces a model for estimating non-binary discrete network parameters that depend on 'distances' defined in terms of path lengths. The model considers an arbitrary number of states associated with such distances. It generalizes previously introduced Monte Carlo simulation methods for reliability estimation to consider other-than-binary distance-dependent states. The suggested method and efficiency improvements relative to crude Monte Carlo are illustrated with a numerical example. © 2012 IEEE."

Research and development aiming at introducing solar energy at large scale has been initiated only recently. A ground measurement network for solar irradiation deployed by Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad de la República, started to operate in 2009, and new measurement sites have been continuously added since then. A first characterization of the solar resource was made in 2009, based only on ground data. More recently, in 2011, a pre-existing statistical satellite-based model proposed by Justus, Paris and Tarpley (JPT) has been implemented and adjusted to the Uruguayan territory. An improved version of the model has then been proposed and implemented. These models are built by integrating data from ground measurement networks with satellite data captured by GOES-East satellites. In this paper we describe the current state of the solar measurement network administrated by Facultad de Ingeniería, as well as other networks of ground stations deployed over the country. We also discuss two satellite-based irradiation models that have been and are being used for solar resource assessment in Uruguay. Performance evaluation and comparison of both models is presented.

The proposed PSS aims to alter the nature of the electric power injected by the wind farms to, in some sense, mimic the oscillatory behavior of synchronous generators and allows dampening these transient oscillations. The main advantage of this stabilizing action lies in the fact that the wind turbines, by decoupling the electrical frequency of the network respect its rotational speed by the inclusion of power electronic converters, allows the injection of oscillating power without risk of suffering stability issues. This allows to improve the oscillation damping between different synchronous generators.The proposed PSS has been analyzed in a grid of three areas: an area comprises the infinite bus; the second one a synchronous generator and the third one contains a synchronous generator and a wind farm. The PSS takes as reference the active power injected by the synchronous generator of the third area using synchrophasors. Finally, it is studied the performance of the PSS for a particular case of the Uruguayan power grid. In this scenario, the second area is composed by the hydro power plant Baygorria; the third area is comprised by the hydro power plant Terra and the wind farms Palmatir and Agua Leguas; finally, the first area is the rest of the power system. 1 © 2012 IEEE."

For this study we used two methods with different basis set: the Full-Potential Augmented Plane Wave plus local orbital (FP-APWlo) and a linear combination of numerical localized atomic orbital basis sets, employing the WIEN2k code and the SIESTA code, respectively. In order to calculate the structural and electronic properties of the reconstructed surface, we calculated the final equilibrium atomic position with the SIESTA code and then the electric-field gradient (EFG) at Al sites was calculated with the FP-APWlo code using the optimized positions. Using this procedure we found equilibrium structures with comparative lower energy than those obtained using only the FP-APWlo method. The EFG tensor and the local structure for Al were studied as a function of the depth from the surface for the relaxed structures. We found that distances down to 6 Å from the surface are sufficient to converge the EFG and the Al-O distances to bulk values. The predicted bulk EFG at the Al site is in good agreement with available experimental values. These results can be used for local probes purposes, e.g., in the case of doping, with important sensitivity for probes located close to the top of the surface, in particular for distances smaller than 6 Å. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Pascal, Rome, Italy","The generation of synthetic signals has been one of the first applications of computers. As a matter of fact the earliest electronic computers were analog and their output was, in effect, a signal. With the advent of digital electronic the initial method employed has been the application of the Fourier Theorem, generating signals as series of sinusoids, a technique deserving a name by its own: ""additive synthesis"". The advantage of the technique is the great control on the parameters of the generated wave. The main disadvantage is the complexity of the computation involved, namely for each component many samples of sinusoid need to be computed, and this usually requires a special hardware to be performed in real time. The reason is that the sine wave, although being natural for physical linear systems, is very complex in the digital domain. This article introduces an effective generalization of the polar flavor of the Fourier Theorem based on a new method of analysis. Under the premises of the new theory an ample class of functions become viable as bases, with the further advantage of using the same basis for analysis and reconstruction. In fact other tools, like the wavelets, admit specially built nonorthogonal bases but require different bases for analysis and reconstruction (biorthogonal and dual bases) and vectorial coordinates; this renders those systems unintuitive and computing intensive. As an example of the advantages of the new generalization of the Fourier Theorem, this paper introduces a novel method for the synthesis that is based on frequency-phase series of square waves (the equivalent of the polar Fourier Theorem but for nonorthogonal bases). The resulting synthesizer is very efficient needing only few components, frugal in terms of computing needs, and viable for many applications. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) is divided in two main types: tropical (TW) and subtropical water (ST). Water masses, Fronts, Inter-Frontal and Frontal Zones are analysed and classified: (a) the water masses: Tropical Low-Salinity Water, Tropical Surface Water, Tropical Tropospheric Water, Subtropical Low-Salinity Water, Subtropical Surface Water, Subtropical Tropospheric Water. T,S characteristics of intermediate, deep and bottom water defined by different authors are confirmed and completed; (b) the Inter-Frontal Zones: Tropical/Brazil Current Zone, Subtropical Zone and Subantarctic Zone; (c) the Frontal Zones: Subtropical, Subantarctic and Polar, and (d) the Fronts: Subtropical Front of the Brazil Current, Principal Subtropical Front, North Subtropical Front, Subtropical Surface Front, South Subtropical Front, Subantarctic Surface Front, Subantarctic Front and Polar Front. Several stable T-S relationships are found below the friction layer and at the Fronts. The maximum gradient of the oceanographic characteristics occurs at the Brazil Current Front, which can be any of the subtropical Fronts, depending on season. Minimum mean depth of the pycnocline coincides with the Fronts of the BMCS, indicating the paths of low-salinity shelf waters into the open ocean.

When accepting new data for storage, deduplication checks whether parts of the data is already stored. If this is the case, then the system does not store that part of the new data but replaces it with a reference to the location where the data already resides. A typical deduplication system breaks data into chunks, hashes each chunk, and uses an index to see whether the chunk has already been stored. Variable chunk systems offer better compression, but process data byte-for-byte twice, first to calculate the chunk boundaries and then to calculate the hash. This limits the ingress bandwidth of a system. We propose a method to reuse the chunk boundary calculations in order to strengthen the collision resistance of the hash, allowing us to use a faster hashing method with fewer bytes or a much larger (256 times by adding two bytes) storage system with the same high assurance against chunk collision and resulting data loss. © 2005 IEEE."

The proposed system utilizes a liquid crystal display, onto which images to be derived are displayed. The method is based on the capacity of these devices to generate simultaneously a contrast reverted replica of the image displayed on it. A positive replica of original image is obtained when the LCD is between crossed polarizers, while the negative one is obtained with the LCD is between parallel polarizers. Since the LCD is a diffraction element, both polarizer arrangements may be simultaneously implemented, for example, in a 4f optical processor using polarization filtering of the different diffraction orders. When three images (two replicas of original image displaced in opposite direction and the other one with contrast reverted and centered at the origin.) are imagined across a slightly defocused plane, one obtains an image with enhanced second derivatives in a given direction. No other incoherent (or partially coherent) optical system is presently known which can perform partial second-order derivatives of an image.

If untreated and sustained, abdominal hypertension can lead to the abdominal compartment syndrome with its high morbidity and mortality. Treatment of severe abdominal hypertension is often surgical. We designed ABDOPRE, a system to non-invasively lower abdominal pressure. A bell-shaped chamber is applied on the patient's abdomen and by means of a vacuum pump a negative pressure is generated in the chamber outside the abdomen. ABDOPRE senses intra-abdominal pressure from an indwelling urinary bladder catheter. The desired value of abdominal pressure and the time allowed to reach this value are entered into the system which servo-controls the vacuum pump, according to treatment protocols. Pressure data of the monitoring/treatment sessions are recorded to allow review of patient response and a daily report is available for the Electronic Medical Record. Preliminary observations were made on intensive care patients. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

An optimization procedure was performed varying four parameters of the model. The best adjustment obtained was when the proportional and derivative factors where the same as for healthy young adults and noise level gain and force feedback gain varied independently. Differences in the latter parameter can be explained because of insufficient and slowed force production necessary to counteract perturbations in Parkinson's disease patients while the former may be due to noise in the sensory system that estimates the vertical deviation angle and/or perturbations in the execution of the movement. © 2010 IEEE.

Consider flow mediated dilatation tests, PWVcr changes are characterized after 5 minutes of TI. It is unknown if lower TI times could be used and if different TI times would result in different PWVcr responses (levels and/or kinetics). Objective: To determine PWVcr changes associated with the reactive hyperemia in response to 1, 3 or 5 minutes of forearm TI. Methods: We measured left PWVcr change using mechano-transducers in healthy volunteers (22±2 years old) before (basal) and after 1 (n=14), 3 (n=14) and 5 (n=15) minutes of TI (forearm cuff inflation), respectively. The change of level and rate in PWVcr were recorded at 15, 30, 45 and 60 seconds after cuff release. Right brachial pressure was measured. Results: There were no changes in heart rate or blood pressure during the studies. Regardless of the occlusion length, TI resulted in PWVcr reduction (p<0.05). The groups showed similar maximum PWVcr reduction. However, there were differences in the immediate PWVcr changes (-4.9±0.2%; - 6.8±0.3% and - 8.3±0.5% for 1, 3 and 5 minutes of TI, respectively) (p<0.05). Then, the immediate rate of PWVcr change differed (p<0.05) among the different ischemia times considered. Thereafter, the differences diminished and a minute after TI the groups showed similar levels and mean rate of PWVcr reduction. Conclusion: Similar maximum PWVcr responses can be obtained after 1, 3, or 5 minutes of TI. Different TI times resulted in dissimilar immediate, but not later, PWVcr changes. © 2010 IEEE."

Today, these lists are statically configured during network planning, which does not allow for dynamic adaptation of the network to changes and unexpected events such as a cell failure. This paper advocates an autonomic, decentralized approach to dynamically configure neighboring cell lists. The main contribution of this work is a novel protocol, called DOC, which detects and continuously tracks the coverage overlaps among cells. The protocol executes on a spanning tree where the nodes are radio base stations and the links represent communication channels. Over this tree, nodes periodically exchange information about terminals that are in their respective coverage area. Bloom filters are used for efficient representations of terminal sets and efficient set operations. The protocol aggregates Bloom filters to reduce the communication overhead and also for routing messages along the tree. Using simulation, we study the system in steady state, when a base station is added or a base station fails, and also during the initialization phase where the system self-configures. © 2010 IEEE."

In these models, the system and its components are considered at a fixed point in time, and the word “static” means that the past or future behavior is not relevant for the analysis. Examples of such models are reliability diagrams, or fault trees. The main difficulty when evaluating the dependability of these systems is the combinatorial explosion associated with exact solution techniques. For large and complex models, one may turn to Monte Carlo methods, but these methods have to be modified or adapted in the presence of rare important events, which are commonplace in reliability and dependability systems. This chapter examines a recently proposed method designed to deal with the problem of estimating reliability metrics for highly dependable systems where the failure of the whole system is a rare event. We focus on the robustness properties of estimators. We also propose improvements to the original technique, including its combination with randomized quasi-Monte Carlo, for which we prove that the variance converges at a faster rate (asymptotically) than for standard Monte Carlo. © Springer 2010."

The main results were that short-term after CRT: 1) there were changes in the static and dynamic determinants of the arterial load; 2) the changes in the load components were not associated with heart rate or pressure variations, but with blood flow changes, and 3) the load components basal levels and their changes after CRT were associated. ©2009 IEEE."

Hence, at present, there is a pressing need to generate alternatives so as to increase the possibilities of obtaining the requested materials. Consequently, it would be of significant interest to establish an intercontinental network for tissue exchange, to improve international cooperation, and to help patients that need tissue transplantation, and to evaluate the feasibility of using an intercontinental network for the exchange of cryopreserved arteries (cryografts), preserving the arterial distensibility and ensuring a reduced native artery-cryograft biomechanical mismatch. Distensibility was studied in ovine arteries divided into three groups: intact (in vivo tests, conscious animals), fresh control (in vitro tests immediately after the artery excision, Uruguay), and cryografts (in vitro tests of cryopreserved-transported-defrosted arteries, Spain). Histological studies were performed so as to analyze changes in the endothelial layer and elastic components. The comparison between fresh control and cryografts showed that neither the cryopreservation nor the exchange network impaired the distensibility, despite the expected histological changes found in the cryografts. The comparison between intact and cryografts showed that the cryografts would be capable of ensuring a reduced biomechanical mismatch. The cryopreservation and the intercontinental network designed for artery exchange preserved the arterial distensibility. It could be possible to transfer cryografts between Latin America and Europe to be used in cardiovascular surgeries and/or for tissue banking reprocessing, with basic biomechanical properties similar to those of the fresh and/or native arteries. © 2009, International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation and Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Recently, in an in vivo model we found a relationship between acute changes in SSR and SSO, and variations in the arterial viscoelasticity. As the arterial viscoelasticity and diameter are the main determinants of the arterial buffering (BF) and conduit (CF) functions, changes in those functions could be expected associated with variations in SSR and SSO. The aim was to analyze the association between acute increases in SSR and SSO, and changes in the aortic CF and BF. Aortic flow, pressure, and diameter were measured in 16 sheep under basal and high reversal and oscillatory flow conditions (high SSR and SSO). Aortic BF and CF were quantified, and their potential association with the SSR and SSO components were analyzed. During high reversal flow rate conditions, a smooth muscle contraction-pattern was evidenced, with an increase in BF and a decrease in CF. Changes in BF and CF were associated with the changes in SSR and SSO. The acute effects on the arterial wall biomechanics of variations in SSR and SSO could contribute to comprehend their chronic effects, and the meaning of the acute vascular effects of changes in SSR and SSO would depend on the situation. Increases in SSR and SSO could be associated with smooth muscle tone increase-dependent changes in arterial BF and CF. © 2009, International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation and Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

It is shown that, under widely accepted assumptions, these models satisfy a balance between the internal storage of a generalized energy and a suitably defined power supply associated to the stator and excitation circuits. This property has particular relevance since it allows to incorporate the detailed model of synchronous machines to classical energy functions used to analyze power system stability. The dissipation inequality implies also that the linear model around the equilibrium point meet a convex condition in the frequency domain, able to be exploited in the stability analysis of interconnected systems.

AS surrogates, derived from the PTTAB and systolic and diastolic pressure were calculated. The myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) was quantified. The AS and MVO2 shows a circadian pattern with the highest and lowest levels, respectively, in the night. The greater reductions in the AS were temporally coincident with the morning increase in the arterial pressure, heart rate, and MVO The lesser AS found during the day-time, could be considered a physiological adaptation to minimize the oxygen consumption during the period of maximal physical activity. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007."

Fresh and cryopreserved human arteries and veins and ePTFE conduits were in-vitro studied in order to analyze their viscoelastic properties. Our results show that ePTFE has an elastic index, which is significantly different from that of the other conduits.

Pascal, Rome, Italy","The famous Fourier theorem states that, under some restrictions, any periodic function (or real world signal) can be obtained as a sum of sinusoids, and hence, a technique exists for decomposing a signal into its sinusoidal components. From this theory an entire branch of research has flourished: from the short-time or windowed Fourier transform to the wavelets, the frames, and lately the generic frequency analysis. The aim of this paper is to take the generic frequency analysis a step further. When a broader paradigm of functional analysis is defined, a much larger class of functions than those initially introduced in [Y. Wei, N. Chen, Square wave analysis, J. Math. Phys. 39 (8) (1998); Y. Wei, Frequency analysis based on general periodic functions, J. Math. Phys. 40 (7) (1999); Y. Wei, Frequency analysis based on easily generated functions, Appl. Comput. Harmon. Anal. (2000)] can be used to assemble bases in L2. New methods and algorithms can be employed in function decomposition on such generic bases. It will be shown that these algorithms are a generalization of the Fourier analysis, i.e., they are reduced to the familiar Fourier tools when using orthogonal bases. The differences between the generic frequency analysis and the wavelets and frames theories will be discussed. Examples of analysis and reconstruction of functions using the given algorithms and generic bases will be given. In this first part the focus will be on vectorial decomposition, while the second part will be on polar decomposition with its consequences and applications. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Expensive sensors are replaced by smarter programs, which, in many cases, satisfactorily accomplish the same functions traditionally performed by the addition of more complex sensors or a greater number of them. The heavier load on the software side, also allows for greater flexibility and the ability to easily adapt to new requirements. In this paper, the performance of a low cost angular positioning system will be evaluated. This system is used to control a homemade goniophotometer, where mechanical components (including sensors and actuators) are given. The goniophotometer is C-g type. Movement around each axis is powered by induction motors, each with its gear reduction box, driven by frequency variators. Motors are mounted on the shafts of the equipment. Angular position measurements are performed by incremental encoders. The encoders are mounted on the shafts of the goniophotometer, too. The control and data acquisition software resides in a PC computer, equipped with function specific dedicated peripherals. These include an encoder signal processing card and another card to communicate with other instruments. To output control signals to the actuators, the PC parallel port is used. The objective is to determine if the inherent limitations of the system components (mechanical and instrumentation) can be attenuated or eliminated by the control software. Disadvantages associated to the existing equipment will be indicated, as well as the way to overcome them where it is possible; or the conditions that have to be met for this disadvantages to be tolerable, where it is not."

These stress factors include insect damage, heat and drought stress, nitrogen deficiency and genetic susceptibility. For example, insect feeding injures corn kernels, creating ports of entry for fungi that produce ear rot and mycotoxins. Biotechnology is helping to provide season-long protection of corn plants (Bt corn) against corn borer damage through the introduction of insect control proteins derived from Bacillus thuringiensis. Reduction of insect feeding damage in Bt corn has led to lower contamination with fumonisin mycotoxins in most locations it has been tested around the world. Biotechnology is also being used to develop healthier corn plants by making them less susceptible to drought stress, increasing nitrogen utilisation, and protecting plants against a wider variety of insect pests that feed on the ears, stalks and roots. In the future, combining these traits will further improve yield and should reduce corn plant susceptibility to environmental stress factors that contribute to mycotoxin contamination in the field. © Wageningen Academic Publishers The Netherlands, 2006."

However, the causes for the superior performance of vein grafts respect ePTFE remain unclear. Our aim was to compare the conduit (CF) and buffering function (BF) of arteries, with those of vein grafts and ePTFE. In vitro pressure (Konigsberg) and diameter (Sonomicrometry) were measured in ovine arteries and veins, and ePTFE prosthesis, under isobaric and physiological pressures levels. From stress-strain relationship the Kelvin-Voigt time constant was calculated to quantify the BF. The CF was evaluated as 1/Z C, where ZC is the characteristic impedance. Vein graft CF and BF were more similar to native arteries than those of ePTFE prosthesis. Consequently, the higher performance of vein grafts could be related with their superior matching with arteries."

Unfortunately this is precisely the case with 3D biological image sequences.

Classically, its kinetic term is not positive definite, and it contains a simple UV regularized F4 interaction. This provokes the formation of a condensate φ ∼ F2 such that, at the saddle point φ̂ of the effective potential, the wave function normalization constant of the abelian gauge fields Zeff(φ̂) vanishes exactly. Then we study SU(2) pure Yang-Mills theory in an abelian gauge and introduce an auxiliary field ρ for a BRST invariant condensate of dimension 2, which renders the charged sector massive. Under simple assumptions its effective low energy theory reduces to the confining abelian model discussed before, and the VEV of ρ is seen to scale correctly with the renormalization point. Under these assumptions, the confinement condition Zeff = 0 also holds for the massive charged sector, which suppresses the couplings of the charged fields to the abelian gauge bosons in the infrared regime."

This means that an intended Connectivity Service is configured end to end in one atomic operation, as seen by the Network Management System (NMS), or not configured at all, if any of the steps of the ongoing operation fails.

Lead iodide Alfa Aesar and synthesized from lead nitrate and potassium iodide was purified by zone refining, zone refining followed by sublimation, repeated sublimation and repeated evaporation, at different conditions. Zone refining was performed at 420°C, 3 cm/hr, 100 passes, repeated sublimation at 390°C and vacuum (10 -5 mmHg) or Ar atmosphere (500 to 580 mmHg) and repeated evaporation at 10 -5 mmHg or in Ar atmosphere (150 to 600 mmHg) and temperature from 450°C to 600°C. Purification methods were evaluated by studying parameters of the purified material like decomposition, stoichiometry, purity and polytype composition and also taking into account purification yield and rate. Stoichiometry was determined by wet procedures, purity by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) and polytypes by powder X-ray diffraction. Evaporation of lead iodide at the highest temperature and moderate Ar pressure (600°C and 500-600 mmHg) proved to be the best way to avoid material decomposition. Sublimation and evaporation give the best stoichiometry (PbI 1.90) especially when compared with zone refining (PbI 1.40). Whatever the purification method, material has an appreciable polytype content. Purity showed similar results for 100 zone refining passes than for 3 evaporations. Furthermore, evaporation exhibits maximum yield and rate (16%/day). Therefore, the work performed points out evaporation in Ar atmosphere as the quickest and more efficient purification method for producing spectrometric grade lead iodide, avoiding material decomposition and achieving high purity, but maintaining the best stoichiometry."

The numerical simulations are based on the Lang-Kobayashi model, and on an extension of the model that includes lateral profiles for the carrier density and the optical field. For moderately strong feedback, intensity pulses characterize the dynamics of the turn-on, with a repetition rate at the external cavity round-trip time. We find that carrier diffusion has an important effect when the laser is biased close to the solitary threshold. For low carrier diffusion the intensity drops to a nearly zero value in between the pulses; for fast carrier diffusion, the spatial holes in the carrier profile burned by the intensity pulses are quickly replenished, and the intensity does not decay to a zero value in between the pulses. The results of our analysis show that the effect of diffusion is qualitatively well modelled by a non-linear gain saturation coefficient different from zero in the s pace-independent Lang-Kobayashi model.

These lateral modes can couple to the thickness mode affecting transducers operation. Such coupling effectively limits the pitch size of the components preventing them to be used in high frequencies. Conventional transducer design will limit the operating frequency of the composite to be half of the pitch resonance in order to avoid mode-coupling effect. For high frequency transducers (>20 MHz) such fine pitch is very difficult to manipulate. Other design techniques reduce the lateral modes by introducing randomness into the structure or varying the elastic properties of the used polymer. In addition earlier works showed that when the wavelength is smaller than the grid periodicity the non-zero diffraction orders produce a spreading in the central field lobe. The main goal of present work was the simultaneous analysis of mode-coupling effects and diffraction field behaviour for non-periodical composite structures. The transducers we designed for this purpose have the first pitch resonance very close to the thickness resonance frequency. The thickness frequency of these composites is at around 0.600 MHz and the lateral mode resonances are at 0.770 MHz and 1.584 MHz, with a volume fraction of 25%. Periodicity is broken by removing a certain number of the ceramic rods in different configurations. The pitch resonance reduction obtained depends is function of the periodical structure defects. The pattern of diffraction field is presented showing the central lobe perturbations caused by the non-periodic grid configurations. In conclusion, optimal non-periodic configurations are identified."

The proposed identification method can be applied to data obtained through compression or bending experimental tests. Wood is an orthotropic material considered as elastoplastic in compression with excellent strength-to-weight ratios, whose use in construction is rapidly increasing. Given the poor mechanical properties of several fast-growing species of coniferous, efficient design methods can play an important role to enhance their performance as structural material. Considering the elastoplastic behaviour might be useful to improve the design process, however, for several species, this analysis is not possible due to the lack of information about the stress–strain relation. This work focuses on developing numerical methods to identify the elastoplastic parameters. A validation procedure is described and applied: synthetic load–strain datasets corresponding to compression and bending tests are generated and random error is introduced before the application of the proposed method. The results show that the method can be used to identify the elastoplastic parameters with precision even when errors are present in the data. Moreover an error estimation analysis is provided. The identification method is also applied to determine the stress–strain curve of Uruguayan Pinus taeda timber, which led to the first results regarding the elastoplastic mechanical characterisation of the species studied. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Strong nonbonded interactions occur between graphene and the Si–H groups. The latter were found to be significantly augmented by the intercalation of Li atoms, which enhanced the SiH::pi interactions. Although the electronic structure of graphene did not experience significant changes when supported on hydrogen-terminated SiC, a small gap of 0.04 eV was computed at the HSEH1PBE/6-31G* level. The clustering of Li atoms over graphene was prevented by the SiC support. A significant enhancement of reactivity could be corroborated due to the presence of intercalated Li atoms, given that the C–H binding energy was increased by almost 1 eV with respect to pristine graphene. We expect that hydrogen-terminated SiC with intercalated Li atoms can be used to enhance the chemical reactivity of graphene, given that it strongly interacts with graphene but does not compete for the electrons donated by Li. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Wines obtained with the conventional Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, were analysed by gas chromatography, and a total of 61 volatile constituents were detected in the volatile fraction and 18 as glycosidically bound aroma compounds. Concentration levels of carbonyl and sulphur compounds were in agreement with the limited information reported about pineapple fruits of other regions. We report, for the first time in pineapple wines, the presence of significant concentrations of lactones, ketones, terpenes, norisoprenoids and a variety of volatile phenols. Eight native yeast strains were isolated from spontaneous batches. Further single-strain fermentations allowed us to characterise their suitability for commercial fermentation. Three native strains (Hanseniaspora opuntiae, H. uvarum and Meyerozyma guilliermondii) were selected with sensory potential to ferment pineapple fruits with increased flavour diversity. Results obtained here contribute to a better understanding of quality fermentation alternatives of this tropical fruit in subtropical regions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

Using input–output analysis, we study all sectors as subsystems of the economy and decompose into different components the total (direct and indirect) emissions generated by their final demand. This analysis provides guidance on the type of policies that should be developed in the different sectors with the aim of mitigating nitrogen oxide emissions. Some sectors that seem less important when looking at their direct emissions turn out to be highly relevant in terms of their total emissions. The results indicate that demand policies can be effective in these sectors, especially in construction, but also in some service sectors that do not appear to be important polluters at first sight.

The electrodeposition was carried out using CdSO4, Na2S2O3 and SeO2 as precursors in an acid solution. Previously, an exhaustive electrochemical study was carried out in order to establish the best condition for the electrodeposition of this structure. In order to confirm the feasibility of the method proposed, CdSxSe(1-x) single-layer films of different composition were electrodeposited and characterized. The electrodeposition of the composition-graded stacked layer arrangement was potentiostatically performed through successive electrodeposition steps in a unique electrolytic solution in which its Se content is gradually increases. The characterization of both, single-layer films and multilayer structure was performed using different techniques, confirming the formation of an alloy between CdS and CdSe. Furthermore, the multilayer structure composition gradually changes from pure CdS to a rich selenium CdSxSe(1-x) compound as the electrolytic solution composition increases its SeO2, forming a depth bandgap graded material. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

Lyngby, Denmark","A steady state model for a production scale milk drying process was built to help process understanding and optimization studies. It involves a spray chamber and also internal/external fluid beds. The model was subjected to a comprehensive statistical analysis for quality assurance using sensitivity analysis of inputs/parameters, and uncertainty analysis to estimate confidence intervals on parameters and model predictions (error propagation). Variance based sensitivity analysis (Sobol's method) was used to quantify the influence of inputs on the final powder moisture as the model output. Bayesian Inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling was used to quantify the uncertainty on the estimated parameters using available process data. In a full scale process the inputs with major range of variation are: moisture content at concentrate chamber feed (variation around 4%), and humidity at chamber inlet air (variation > 100%). The sensitivity analysis results suggest exploring improvements in the current control (Proportional Integral Derivative) for moisture content at concentrate chamber feed in order to reduce the output variance. It is also confirmed that humidity control at chamber inlet air stream would not be necessary because, despite its wide range of variation (air taken from outside), its impact on output variance is low. The uncertainty analysis results showed that confidence intervals obtained for parameters were reasonable, although some of them were found significantly correlated. For model applications, this means that model simulations should be performed using not only parameter values but also their correlation matrix by means of non-linear error propagation methods such as Monte Carlo techniques. The separate effects on model prediction uncertainties due to parameter estimation and measurement errors were studied. The results indicate that the error in measurements is the main responsible for the uncertainty in output predictions. Therefore using proper filtering of measurements, the comprehensively tested model is ready to support simulation based efforts for further process optimization. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd."

This is particularly challenging in the agricultural sector given the heterogeneity of local conditions, the diffuse nature of its environmental impacts, and the important interactions with various aspects of sustainable development – from education and poverty alleviation, to human health and the environment. And yet it is precisely because of these interactions that vibrant, resilient and sustainable national agricultural sectors are key to the SDGs’ success. This paper presents a practical backcasting approach and methodological toolkit – developed by the Agricultural Transformation Pathways (ATP) initiative under the auspices of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) – for countries to develop policy roadmaps towards 2030 using local tools and expertise that could help transform national agricultural sectors in a way that is consistent with the SDGs. This approach is illustrated using the Uruguayan beef sector as a case study, where productivity and environmental targets were developed in tandem with a wide range of stakeholders in order to maximize productivity, while minimizing a suite of environmental impacts – from carbon footprint and biodiversity, to nitrogen losses. This marks the beginning of a new approach to achieving the SDGs in the agricultural sector: participatory target setting and pathway development across a number of areas crucial to sustainable development – all under a harmonized framework provided by the ATP initiative. We hope the methodological approach and results of the Uruguay case study will become a touchstone for future work in this area. © 2016"

Two different, but equivalent, novel necessary and sufficient conditions for uniform exponential stability in switched systems of this class are presented and proved in the paper. A switched positive linear system with rank-one modes is proved to be uniformly exponentially stable if and only if the spectral radii of an specific finite set of matrices associated to the system are smaller than one. It is also proved that the uniform exponential stability of a switched positive linear system with rank-one modes is equivalent to the feasibility of specific sets of linear inequalities associated to the system; thus allowing for a computationally efficient uniform exponential stability determination in this class of switched systems. This last result is furthermore a constructive converse Lyapunov theorem; establishing that each feasible solution to the aforementioned linear inequalities yields to (or generates) a common Lyapunov function, for the switched system, which is represented by as many linear functionals as modes the switched system has. An example is included that illustrates the results reported in the paper. © 2016 American Automatic Control Council (AACC)."

Through numerical examples, the authors show that the method fails when the number of hydrants supplied by a pipe is small or when the nominal flow rate of the hydrants is nonhomogeneous. In such cases, the normality hypothesis of the design flow rate random variable, an assumption needed by Clément's formula, cannot be made. An alternative method for calculating the design flow rate as a nonnormal random variable is presented. The method works very well in all analyzed examples, mainly because the normality hypothesis is not required. The paper also provides a free-software R-script using freely available software that allows applying the proposed method to user-defined cases. The script helps to understand the method's theoretical basis and can be used as a tool for checking the assumption of normality of data.

This paper models and analyzes a half-duplex, frequency shift keying RFID system with one additional coil between the reader and the tag, considering both phases (charging and reading) of this bidirectional operation. A three-coil RFID system was designed using a commercial tag (RI-INL-R9QM widely used in cattle identification), reader (using a TMS3705), and the additional resonant coil (whose radius and quality factor were optimized). In addition, the influence of high coil quality factor is addressed for steady-state and transient response. The designed system increases almost 2.7 × the original RFID read distance (from 16 to 43 cm). The analytical design and measurements data are in good agreement.

Within the United States (US), an aging National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Department of Defense (DoD) workforce, as well as the need to create a more diverse STEM workforce, are impetuses for accelerated efforts that focus upon STEM education and careers. Such efforts are also continuously gaining traction in South Africa; a nation dedicated to overcoming the negative education disparities that resulted from apartheid. As the result of a mutual interest in promoting STEM education and careers among Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) students in the US and South Africa, an academic partnership was established in 2012 between the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) in Huntsville, Alabama (AL), and the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) in Cape Town, South Africa. The partnership is referred to as the ALLiance for International Excellence among the future Space workforce (ALLIES). One of the primary goals of ALLIES is to design and develop STEM tools within engineering capstone design classes at UAH and CPUT. Upon completion, the STEM tools are donated to various K-12 schools in the US and South Africa. The STEM tools adhere to stringent curriculum and product requirements-with safety as a top-level requirement. Another critical goal of ALLIES is the enablement of international design efforts that provide engineering students opportunities to gain invaluable experience working, interacting, and communicating with, an international partner. The objective of the present investigation is to determine the impact of the international design collaboration upon the engineering design students, and the benefits of the STEM tools upon the K-12 students. In order to specifically promote aerospace engineering, the ALLIES partnership has focused upon the design and development of wind tunnels that are donated to primary and secondary education schools. Previously designed UAH capstone design class wind tunnels have proven to spark interest in aerospace related phenomena among K-12 students and, as a result, wind tunnels quickly became the preferred STEM tool developed via the ALLIES partnership. The most recent effort focuses upon the design of a wind tunnel that can be fabricated using materials, parts, and components available in most regions of the world, such that disadvantaged schools can easily replicate one. The present paper will focus upon the ALLIES wind tunnel design process, the educational impact upon the engineering design students, as well as the recipient K-12 students. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016."

Italia 3318, Montevideo, Uruguay","Background: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Nanotechnology approaches can overcome the side effects of chemotherapy as well as improve the efficacy of drugs. Dendrimers are nanometric size polymers which are suitable as drug delivery systems. To the best of our knowledge, studies on the application of PAMAM G4.5 (polyamidoamine half generation 4) dendrimers as potential drug delivery systems in breast cancer have not been reported. In this work we developed a PAMAM G4.5 dendrimer containing FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) dye to study their uptake by murine breast cancer cells and BALB/c mice breast tumors. Results: We performed a reaction between FITC and PAMAM G4.5 dendrimers which were previously derivatized with piperazine (linker molecule), characterized them by 1H NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization- time-of-flight) mass spectrometry. The experimental data indicated that 2 FITC molecules could be bound covalently at the PAMAM G4.5 dendrimer surface, with 17 FITC molecules probably occluded in PAMAM dendrimers cavity. PAMAM-FITC dendrimer (PAMAM G4.5-piperazinyl-FITC dendrimer) size distribution was evaluated by DLS (dynamic light scattering) and TEM (transmission electron microscopy). The nanoparticle hydrodynamic size was 96.3 ± 1.4 nm with a PdI (polydispersion index) of 0.0296 ± 0.0171, and the size distribution measured by TEM was 44.2 ± 9.2 nm. PAMAM-FITC dendrimers were neither cytotoxic in 4T1 cells nor hemolytic up to 24 h of incubation. In addition, they were uptaken in vitro by 4T1 cells and in vivo by BALB/c mice breast tumors. PAMAM G4.5-piperazinyl-FITC dendrimer intracellular distribution was observed through histologic analysis of the tumor by laser confocal microscopy. Conclusion: These results indicate that PAMAM G4.5 dendrimers enter tumor tissue cells, being good candidates to be used as antitumor drug delivery systems for breast cancer treatment and diagnosis. © 2016 The Author(s)."

Our main objective is to predict the fatigue life of materials by providing a systematic approach to model calibration, model selection and model ranking with reference to S-N data. To this purpose, we consider fatigue-limit models and random fatigue-limit models that are specially designed to allow the treatment of the run-outs (right-censored data). We first fit the models to the data by maximum likelihood methods and estimate the quantiles of the life distribution of the alloy specimen. To assess the robustness of the estimation of the quantile functions, we obtain bootstrap confidence bands by stratified resampling with respect to the cycle ratio. We then compare and rank the models by classical measures of fit based on information criteria. We also consider a Bayesian approach that provides, under the prior distribution of the model parameters selected by the user, their simulation-based posterior distributions. We implement and apply Bayesian model comparison methods, such as Bayes factor ranking and predictive information criteria based on cross-validation techniques under various a priori scenarios. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.."

Often, it corresponds to forcing the processor to execute a test program (which could be an application one), observing the produced results (e.g., by looking at the results written in the memory at the end of the test program execution). However, the fault coverage that can be achieved in this way is often difficult to compute, and limited by the reduced observability. In this paper we propose to use the debug features provided by many processors to enhance the observability, and hence the achieved fault coverage. In the proposed architecture we monitor on-the-fly during the test program execution the information accessible through the debug port using an ad hoc module mapped on an FPGA which is assumed to exist close to the processor. We provide experimental results showing the feasibility and cost of the approach, and demonstrate that it can provide a significant increase in the achieved fault coverage with respect to the popular solution of observing the final content of the memory. © 2016 IEEE."

In the laboratory experiments, both a confluence and a cylinder set-up were studied in order to validate the bluff body analogy, which has been proposed to characterize the mixing interface. The experimental characterization included flow visualization and the computation of the mean flow field, time scales of the coherent structures, and turbulent kinetic energy. The comparison among the two configurations confirms the validity of the analogy as similar features were found for the mean flow field and time scales of the coherent structures. However, differences in the length of the stagnation zone, the flow velocity deficit, and the turbulence intensity were observed. These differences should be taken into account when the bluff body analogy is used to characterize the confluence hydrodynamics and to quantify the mixing at the confluence interface.

One drawback of this measurement is the low sensitivity of the signal against changes in strain. This problem can be solved using inverse filter signal processing. This technique increases the sensitivity but also reduces the energy of the signal and, consequently, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Thus, a physical solution is presented to improve the sensitivity of the system. Additionally, the one-bit time reversal is introduced to simplify the hardware used in this technique. The strain sensing system is composed of a pair of piezocomposite transducers bonded to the surface of the tested plate and used to generate and sense the ultrasonic waves guided through the specimen. The use of time reversal provides phase compensation for dispersion and edge reflections in the propagation of the guided waves in the plate, allowing time recompression of the waves. The measurement principle is based on the detection of changes in the amplitude and time-of-flight of the focused signal when the plate is subjected to longitudinal strains. System sensitivity is improved using 2-2 piezocomposite transducers designed to operate between 0.2 and 3.0 MHz. In the signal processing, the one-bit time reversal is compared with the conventional time reversal in 12-bit resolution. A figure of merit is introduced to evaluate the influence of the transfer function on strain sensitivity. This figure of merit relates the energy concentrated at the time-reversal focus with the total energy of the signal. This value represents the ability of the time-reversal process to recompress the signal at the focus. The experiments were conducted by applying strains up to 150 μm/m. The results show a linear response in the change of the focus amplitude. The sensitivity depends on the transducers and it can be related to the proposed figure of merit. The focus quality is kept when one-bit time reversal is used, showing to be also feasible for the measuring technique. All the results agreed with the numerical time-reversal implementation. © 2016 IEEE."

This problem has been considered in important applications such as the design of methodologies for breast cancer diagnosis. Since the resolution of real life problems involves high computational costs, there is great interest in the development of efficient methods. In this paper two new efficient formulations of the problem are presented. The first formulation leads to a second-order cone optimization problem, and the second one leads to a quadratic optimization problem, both allowing the resolution of the problem with high efficiency and precision. Numerical examples are solved using synthetic input data with error. A regularization technique is applied using the Morozov criterion along with an automatic selection strategy of the regularization parameter. The proposed formulations present great advantages in terms of efficiency, when compared to other formulations that require the application of general nonlinear optimization algorithms. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

However, the lack of scientific evidence of the quality or efficiency of these methods, leads us to question if this approach is necessary for software security experts. This article proposes an experimental approach to explore if software development artifacts are relevant when making security decisions in software development, and how are they used. We have designed a survey in order to ask these questions to software security and architecture experts. We used the Constant Comparison Method in order to find emerging security theories about software artifacts, grounded in the answers of the experts. Our results add experimental evidence into the use and usefullness of software development artifacts in helping to reduce security vulnerabilities in practice, from the experts point of view. Our results add experimental evidence into the use and usefulness of software development artifacts to evaluate the security from the point of view of the experts. Our evidence suggests that not all software artifacts are equally useful in the design of secure architectures, considering the ""Use Cases"" and ""Class Diagrams"" as the most useful artifacts according to our respondents. Also, our evidence suggest that experts do not agree in the importance of analyzing security concerns through the whole software life cycle, nor in the abstraction level required for this task. © 2015 IEEE."

This provides an interesting opportunity considering the exponential growth in wireless communications and applications, which results in an important demand for higher bandwidth to achieve an adequate performance. To operate in bands that are already licensed, it is necessary to ensure that this operation does not cause any interference to the primary user, and always gives priority to it. In this context the IEEE has been defining a standard with functionalities of Cognitive Radio that allows operation in licensed bands opportunistically, and without causing interference. From there comes the IEEE 802.22 standard, which has a set of features and procedures to measure, monitor and manage the radio spectrum, essential to ensure the protection of primary users transmissions. Some pilot projects have demonstrated the potential of this standard to provide broadband services comparable to classical ADSL services, especially in remote or rural areas inaccessible to deploy fixed networks. One of the great challenges to install such systems commercially, is to achieve the permissions for the operation and to have a defined regulation for these systems, decisions that are in the hands of the telecommunications services regulators in each country.

In particular, the methodology evaluated in this paper uses a features learning method that combines a quantification process of 2D structural information of materials with the autoencoder method. Several inferred models for tensile strength at break, which is a mechanical property of materials, are discussed. These results are contrasted to QSPR models generated by traditional approaches using accuracy metrics and a visual analytic tool. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."

Herrera y Reissig 565, Montevideo, Uruguay","Pattern recognition and localization along with feature extraction are image processing applications of great interest in defect inspection and robot vision among others. In comparison to purely digital methods, the attractiveness of optical processors for pattern recognition lies in their highly parallel operation and real-time processing capability. This work presents an optical implementation of the generalized Hough transform (GHT), a well-established technique for the recognition of geometrical features in binary images. Detection of a geometric feature under the GHT is accomplished by mapping the original image to an accumulator space; the large computational requirements for this mapping make the optical implementation an attractive alternative to digital- only methods. Starting from the integral representation of the GHT, it is possible to device an optical setup where the transformation is obtained, and the size and orientation parameters can be controlled, allowing for dynamic scale and orientation-variant pattern recognition. A compact system for the above purposes results from the use of an electrically tunable lens for scale control and a rotating pupil mask for orientation variation, implemented on a high-contrast spatial light modulator (SLM). Real-time (as limited by the frame rate of the device used to capture the GHT) can also be achieved, allowing for the processing of video sequences. Besides, by thresholding of the GHT (with the aid of another SLM) and inverse transforming (which is optically achieved in the incoherent system under appropriate focusing setting), the previously detected features of interest can be extracted. © 2016 SPIE."

We study systems which can be either in 'up' or 'down' state, according to their ability to comply with their stated mission given the subset of components under operation, through a function φ :P(S) → {0,1}, called structure. A stochastic binary system (SBS) is the triad (S, p, φ), and the reliability r of an SBS is the probability that the system is up. The reliability evaluation of an arbitrary SBS belongs to the class of NP-Hard computational problems. Therefore, there is no polynomial time algorithm to find r for every SBS, unless P = NP. The goal of this paper is to study approximation algorithms to accurately estimate the reliability of a stochastic monotone binary system, or SMBS, where its structure is monotonous. First, two Monte Carlo approaches are discussed. Then, the Recursive Variance Reduction (RVR) method (designed originally for the particular case of network reliability) is generalized to estimate the reliability of an SBMS. The performance of these algorithms under different SMBS (inspired mainly in network design and k-out-of-m structures) is illustrated numerically.

The exact evaluation of the diameter constrained reliability belongs to the class of NP-Hard problems, and becomes prohibitive in large graphs. In the literature, several estimation methods have been developed, inspired in statistics, combinatorics, algebra and other branches of knowledge. We are focused on the statistical evaluation of the diameter constrained reliability under rare event scenarios. Under these assumptions (highly reliable networks), Crude Monte Carlo method is not accurate. More sophisticated methods meet both accuracy and bounded relative error. We compare the performance of two variance reduction methods, to know, Approximate Zero Variance Importance Sampling (AZVIS) and Recursive Variance Reduction (RVR). These methods are compared to Crude Monte Carlo in terms of accuracy and computational effort. Numerical comparisons show the improvement in the global performance of these alternative statistical methods.

All windings are at nearly ground potential during laboratory calibration because this is the typical configuration for almost all CT's calibration systems. However, in service, the primary winding is at high potential, so that additional currents flow through the load due to stray capacitances between primary and secondary windings, even if the CT has an electrostatic shield for reducing these capacitances. This effect changes the CT errors determined at no potential. Experimental determination of the variation of ratio and phase displacement errors between both working conditions is evaluated for a set of different CTs using different measuring systems. These systems include from the simplest low-voltage bridge capacitance measurement to the most complex one that simultaneously applies current and voltage. © 1963-2012 IEEE."

These represent one of the major costs for construction companies, and can rise up to 60% of the total cost of the project.The existing standards and authors that refer to the striking of vertical formworks (columns and walls), present many differences in estimated striking times; moreover, there is no universally accepted method to predict these. Generally, the mechanism and time of striking are arbitrarily decided at the construction site and there is no theory to relate environmental and concrete factors with the optimal formwork striking times.In this article, a methodology for striking vertical concrete elements by means of the Maturity Method is presented, which takes into consideration the temperature variations between pouring and striking of concrete. This methodology can predict the minimum striking time independently from the type of concrete, by continuously measuring its maturity index at the construction site.

To achieve this goal, laccase-producing strains isolated from Eucalyptus globulus were screened and white rot fungus Trametes villosa was selected as the best strain for enzyme production. Reduction of disulfide bonds and introduction of ""de novo"" thiol groups in partially purified laccase were assessed to perform its reversible covalent immobilization onto thiol-reactive supports (TSI-agarose). Only the thiolation process dramatically improved the immobilization yield, from 0% for the native and reduced enzyme to 60% for the thiolated enzyme. Mild conditions for the immobilization process (pH 7.5 and 4°C) allowed the achievement of nearly 100% of coupling efficiency when low loads were applied. The kinetic parameters, pH, and thermal stabilities for the immobilized biocatalyst were similar to those for the native enzyme.

In order to save the valuable energy it would be instrumental to measure the energy consumption by every deployed node on the field. Prospective applications include, energy-aware routing and hardware diagnosis for detecting subsystems' faults or unusual power consumption. In this work we propose a measurement method and circuit, named Smart Coulomb Counter (SCC), that easily adds to a sensor node the capability of measuring its own energy consumption. This hardware-based approach consists in duty-cycling the measurement circuit together with the sensor node, thus lowering its power consumption. Experimental results demonstrates that SCC has a very low power consumption, ensuring an almost negligible impact in the battery lifetime. Other advantages of SCC include high dynamic range, high linear range, very low temperature drift, independence of the power supply, easy to integrate and low resource requirements in terms of memory and processor usage, as well as in terms of component count (area and cost). A fully-functional prototype based on the sensor node TelosB running ContikiOS was developed.

M. hubbsi is a species living in temperate-cold Sub-Antarctic waters related to the Malvinas/Falklands Current system, between 22° and 55°S. This species of hake is sexually dimorphic, with females larger than males. Maximum observed size (total length) is 60 cm for males and 90 cm for females, with longevity of 10 and 15 years, respectively. Females in the AUCFZ become mature between 27 and 34 cm, whereas males mature at 27 cm. At least four spawning and nursery areas are recognised in the AUCFZ. M. hubbsi is a pelagic and demersal species that performs daily vertical migrations to feed in the upper layers of the ocean during the night and is an active and opportunistic predator that changes its diet during its lifetime. Assessment surveys conducted in the AUCFZ have shown a marked long-term decrease in M. hubbsi density and mean individual size. The historical analysis revealed higher vulnerability to fishing of the youngest age groups through time. Since 1998, juveniles (individuals ≤ 35 cm of total length and ≥ 3 years) represented moregreat than 80% in the AUCFZ, and adult hake comprised only 5% of the stock structure. The M. hubbsi fishery is single species and targeted by Uruguayan and Argentinean fleets in the AUCFZ, where this fishing resource is shared by both countries. This fishing resource is also exploited by foreign fleets in international waters and by Argentina in its own Economic Exclusive Zone. Within the AUCFZ, total landings made by Uruguay and Argentina decreased from an average of 110,000 t in 1980-1990 to 46,000 t during the first decade of the twenty-first century. The largest landings were recorded in 1991, reaching 195,000 t, decreasing thereafter and reaching 30,000 50,000 t between the years 2000 and 2010. Uruguayan landings increased as a result of increasing demand from foreign markets and the steady increase in the unit prices of fishery products, from 10,000 to 93,000 t between the years 1975 and 2010. Uruguayan landings peaked in 1991 (97,000 t), decreasing thereafter and reaching approximately 33,000 t in 2010. Long-term trends in catch per unit effort estimated for the Uruguayan fleet reflected catch variations, decreasing from 1998 kg hour in 1977 to 558 kg per hour in 2010. In Uruguay, M. hubbsi historically accounted for the highest export revenues among all exported marine products since the 1970s. The unit price has shown a sinusoidal increasing trend through time, reaching the highest value in 1999 (US$ 3500 per tonne exported). Exportation trends also increased over time, reaching 83% of the total catch in 2006. A monotonic decreasing function between total catch and unit price suggests a marked increase in the demand for M. hubbsi, jointly with warnings of stock depletion. A fishery improvement program should be implemented throughout the entire distribution range of the species in the SAO. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. All rights reserved."

Furthermore, process improvement initiatives have been proven useful in increasing the productivity of a software organization. As such, these organizations need to decide where to invest their training budget. As a result, training in technological update to their workforce or training in process conformance with its productive processes become conflicting alternatives. This paper presents a system dynamics simulation of a software factory product line. The objective of this simulation is to understand the changes in behavior when selecting either one of the above-training alternatives. The system dynamics model was validated with an expert panel, and the simulation results have been empirically validated—using statistical process control—against the performance baseline of a real software development organization. With the simulation under statistical control and performing like the baseline, the independent variables representing process conformance (process training) and technology skills (skills training) were modified to study their impact on product defects and process stability. Our results show that while both variables have positive impact on defects and process stability, investment in process training results in a process with less variation and with fewer defects. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

In this paper we introduce a new algorithm to obtain an approximation of the radiosity inverse matrix. The method is based on the calculation of a random sample of rows of the form factor matrix. The availability of this matrix allows us to reduce the radiosity calculation costs, speeding up the radiosity process. This is useful in applications where the radiosity equation must be solved thousands of times for different light configurations. We apply it to solve inverse lighting problems, in scenes up to 170 K patches.

Here, we analyse and quantify the influence of different construction process parameters on the effectiveness of the bi-layer diaphragm wall technique. Thirty numeric simulations were conducted with an uncoupled structure-section analysis, placing special emphasis on the SFRC layer contribution. The results show that, in all cases, the main flexural strength is provided by the RC layer, with a secondary flexural contribution (between 8% and 15%) by the sprayed SFRC layer. Using satisfactory spraying sequences (detailed herein), a reduction in the steel reinforcement of the RC layer can be obtained in every structural configuration and construction sequence, reaching a maximum percentage reduction of 7.0% of the total bending reinforcement. The displacements are almost completely governed by the thickness of the first layer, and a minor reduction (less than 7.3%) is obtained, when the second layer is included. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

The implemented models, which are well known, are briefly described. The measuring method is more thoroughly described as there is no established procedure and the spectrum analyzer's settings are discussed. Spatial validation, using neighbouring points is proposed. The measuring method is validated both by its coincidence with the Friis formula for free space propagation, when this condition arises, and by the consistency between neighbouring points.

This work develops a methodology to estimate the economic value of water in a basin with large hydropower production and a growing demand for rice irrigation, based on a coupled hydrological and electric system modelling approach. Inflow deficits to the hydroelectric system induced by the irrigation reservoirs within the basin are simulated under different irrigation scenarios. The simulated inflow deficits are integrated to an existing model of the interconnected electric system to evaluate the associated increase in generation costs under different energy scenarios. The impact of inflow deficits in turbinated and spilled flow and generation costs are comprehensively explored. Both annual mean and interannual variability of overcosts increase with increasing irrigation demand. However, if normalized by yearly varying rice planted area, the distribution of additional costs does not change substantially. Moreover, the distribution of normalized overcosts per unit irrigated area is also invariant to energy scenarios, although the relative impact in total costs decreases as the proportion of hydroelectric generation diminishes. © 2014, Water Resour Manage, All rights Reserved."

Both architectures are based on a counter-comparator block to process the most significant bits (MSB) portion of the reference input, enriched with additional elements to enhance duty-cycle resolution according to the less significant bits (LSB). The first architecture described has already been reported in the literature, it uses the on-chip PLL blocks to generate fixed delays and a selector to choose the one corresponding with the desired duty-cycle. Post-fitting adjustments of PLL delays are required to compensate delay differences between the diverse signal paths across the selector. In the second architecture described, a serializer-deserializer (SERDES) module is used to serialize a thermometer-coded representation of the LSB portion of the input. This serialization technique is commonly used for data transmission on high-speed serial I/O data transmission standards like LVDS and is extensively supported by FPGA providers. Experimental results are presented for both architectures synthesized on standard low-cost FPGA chips, showing very good linearity and resolutions up to 1ns.

In our experimental set-up, the flow was driven by combined impinging jet and density perturbations forcing with the aim of determining their relative influence on the overall microburst behavior and, in particular, the initiation and structural evolution of the resulting vortex. These results were compared with those reported in the previous simulation works. Such comparisons showed that the laboratory model may satisfactorily reproduce relevant aspects of a microburst. An expression for the characteristic microburst propagation velocity was derived, accounting for the combined effects of forced velocity and flotation forces generated by the density difference, whose predictions are in good agreement with experimental data. The vortex structure is largely affected by the forcing type. The succession of vortex is best defined when a large density perturbation is combined with a weak jet impingement. The opposite configuration causes a main vortex to be succeeded by a wake where vortex structures are not clearly defined. Such behavior is caused by the fact that larger density perturbations inhibit the mean and turbulent velocities, favouring a well defined vortices structure, associated with weaker momentum diffusion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

More specifically, we present the design and analysis of the interface electronic circuit between the touch sensor transducer and the signal conditioning circuit stage. The circuit configuration is based on a NMOS transistor in common-drain and floating gate bias configuration. Such configuration enhances and complements the transducer's response. However, the circuit interface design suffers of the very difficult analytical tractability. For this reason, a graphical methodology, intended to give a criterion for achieving the selection of the most appropriate bias resistance value has been developed. The methodology utilizes the Advanced Compact MOSFET (ACM) model and the gm characteristic as function of the NMOS transistor drain current ID. A design space map shows confidence regions where the specifications such as touch sensing device gain, current consumption and source resistance value are met. The design methodology enables to push the performance of the POSFET by selecting the most appropriate bias resistance value and it reduces time-consuming iterations which are normally required. As a proof of concept of the proposed methodology, measurements as well as a design example are presented. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

In the closed geometry the pair of quasi-symmetric counter-rotating vortices remains instead in the open geometry those structures disappear giving way to smaller ones. The temperature field is practically the same above the plate encasing the PCB, differences appear below the plate.

Italia 2364, Montevideo, Uruguay; Cardelino, J., ICUC GmbH, Av. Italia 2364, Montevideo, Uruguay",In trauma and orthopedic surgery screw assessment and trajectory prediction using two-dimensional X-ray images is very difficult due to projected 3D information. However screw assessment can be done with multiple X-ray images. If the X-ray image contains the projected implant geometry it can be used as global coordinate reference. Thereby multiple independent X-ray images can be synchronized by estimating the implant pose in each single image. Consequently high accuracy pose estimation is fundamental. To measure the outcome quality an evaluation process has been designed. The evaluation process investigates in its first step several clinical intra-operative anterior-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) X-ray images which have been analyzed using a manual pose estimation method. With the manual method the six 3D parameters of the implant pose are estimated. These parameters define as well the camera pose relative to the implant. Based on the pose parameters of all clinical cases the capturing range for typical AP and ML images is statistically defined. The implant was attached to a phantom with 16 steel balls which allows to calculate the ground truth pose. Afterwards several X-ray images of the phantom are taken within the statistically defined capturing range. With the known ground truth different pose estimation methods can be compared. For each method the estimation quality can be calculated. In addition this error calculation can be used to adjust the initial manually determined capturing range. This paper explains the error evaluation process and describes how to validate pose estimation methods for clinical applications. © 2013 SPIE.

This article considers different criteria to assess the impact that missing data can have when running three-level designs to estimate a full second-order polynomial model. Designs for three to seven factors were studied and included Box-Behnken designs, face-centered composite designs, and designs due to Morris, Mee, Block-Mee, Draper-Lin, Hoke, Katasaounis, and Notz. These designs were studied under two existing robustness criteria: (i) the maximum number of runs that can be missing and still allow the remaining runs to estimate a given model; and (ii) the loss of D-efficiency in the remaining design compared with the original design. The robustness of three-level designs was studied using a third, new criterion: the maximum number of observations that can be missing from a design and still allow the estimation of the given model with a high probability. This criterion represents a useful generalization of the first criterion, which determines the maximum number of runs that make the probability of estimating the model equal to one. The new criterion provides a better assessment of the robustness of each design than previous criteria. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Recent trends to maximize the efficiency of the existing optical infrastructure through the virtualization of optical connections, has as its main drawback that a single point of physical failure can unleash simultaneous failures in multiple connections. From this intrinsic characteristic of next-generation-network architectures, several multilayer-network problems arise, whose complexity is at least as hard as those of the corresponding single-layer problems. This article addresses the problem of designing a minimum-cost, fault-tolerant IP/MPLS network, to be deployed over an existing DWDM infrastructure. Besides cost and resiliency, this work also integrates traffic and capacity constraints.

For an ordinary differential equation model of the multi-class peer populations, we characterize the equilibrium and establish its global stability, invoking results from monotone systems. We also analyze a partial differential equation model that tracks download progress of the populations; we establish the local asymptotic stability of the equilibrium.

In this paper we demonstrate that, on the contrary, the straightforward deployment of 802.11n in conjunction with TCP over a simple, single access-point network, can dramatically underachieve the promised speeds. Part of the deficiency is due to overheads and can be improved by the technique of packet aggregation present in the standard. However more subtle problems are identified, in particular the downward equalization of throughputs that occurs under physical rate diversity, or the unreasonable portion of resources taken by uplink flows when competing with the more numerous downlink connections. These difficulties are demonstrated and their causes explained through a sequence of experiments with the ns3 packet simulator. Our analysis leads us to propose a desirable resource allocation for these situations of competition, and an architecture for control in the access-point to achieve it. Our solution involves a combination of packet aggregation, multiple queues and TCPACK isolation, compatible with the standard and where all the control resides at the AP. We demonstrate analytically and through extensive simulation that our method is able to provide significant enhancements in performance under a variety of traffic conditions. © 2012 IEEE."

However, with chopped waveforms, many impulse generators have significant differences in the time of chopping that make difficult to get a conclusion on the test result. This paper presents a new algorithm that generates reduced-level chopped voltage and current waveforms, with arbitrary chopping time, from a couple of reduced voltage of full and chopped waveforms.

A comparison is made in relation to the case with no DG placed in the network, to the case with controllable DG and to the case of intermittent DG of different capacity factors. We find that in expectation intermittent wind DG does little to reduce overall line losses or reduce peak line utilization.

It becomes necessary, therefore, to develop studies which allow understanding the behaviour of the electrical system once that generation is present. This paper aims to deepen and assist in the analysis of one of the key aspects for the incorporation of wind generation, its response to a voltage dip and how it affects the operation of the electrical system. To do so, a number of analysis methodologies were developed, which allow to evaluate both the behaviour of the electrical system as a whole, and the individual behaviour of each of the nodes where wind generation is planned to be connected, upon the occurrence of short circuits in the transmission network. In particular, an analysis methodology based on the vulnerability areas study has been developed and implemented. From its application on the Uruguayan electrical transmission system it is possible to determine, for example, the maximum number of wind farms expected disconnections due to a voltage dip over a year, as well as other statistical information of great interest. It is worth mentioning that although the Uruguayan electrical system has been taken as the application case for these study methodologies, they are applicable to any electrical system. © 2012 IEEE."

Recent studies have proposed that the capacitive or reservoir function of the aorta and large elastic arteries plays a major role in determining the pulse wave morphology. The pressure waveform can be explained in terms of a reservoir pressure related to arterial compliance and an excess or wave-related pressure associated with traveling waves. Gender-differences in the ascending aorta pressure waveform reservoir and excess components are to be characterized.

This structure determines that bismuth tri-iodide crystals can grow with platelet habit. Thereby, we consider of great importance to study if such structure can determine nanoparticles of this material as well, that means, if such layers can be rolled in order to form nanotubes and/or nanorods. In light of this, the present work reports the synthesis of bismuth tri-iodide nanoparticles by the suspension method. Bi(NO3) 3.5H2O, l2 and Kl were used as source materials, and 1-octadecene was used as suspension agent. The intermediate and final synthesized compounds were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results clearly show that Bil3 nanoparticles can be synthesized by the suspension method, which means that the layer structure of these compounds can determine the growth of nanostructures. Nanoparticles of different sizes and morphologies were obtained, depending on the synthesis conditions. There has been not possible to control such conditions in order to obtain uniform size and morphology distributions. The use of these nanostructures may be an interesting way of improving nucleation and further growth of bismuth tri-iodide films. © 2012 Materials Research Society."

However, the average daily traffic is approximately 100 trucks during harvest time. The local soils, characterized as clayey silts, are unsuitable for such traffic demands and are generally replaced or reinforced by materials found more than 70 km away, with high transportation costs. An investigation of the performance of a full-scale test section of pavement with a base layer of local silty clay soil stabilized with lime was conducted. The design of the test section consisted of soil selection, determination of lime content for stabilization, compaction, and California bearing ratio laboratory tests. Two test sections, each 50 m, were built, with a base layer of selected soil mixed with 3% lime in one section and with 5% lime in the other. After the rice harvest, the performance of the test sections was evaluated by visual observation of the base layer and deflection measures with a Benkelman beam. Despite some construction difficulties, the deflection average values changed from 244 × 10-2 cm immediately after the section was built to 77 × 10-2 cm 4 months later. The use of soil-lime material for base layers of low-volume roads is a technical and economical alternative that provides a significant improvement of the rural road network with socioeconomic benefits."

Local regulations specify that 10% of the crop should be a non-GM cultivar as refuge area for biodiversity, and the distance from other non-GM maize crops should be more than 250 m in order to avoid cross-pollination. However, the degree of cross-fertilization between maize crops in Uruguay is unknown. The level of adventitious presence of GM material in non-GM crops is a relevant issue for organic farming, in situ conservation of genetic resources and seed production. In the research reported here, the occurrence and frequency of cross-fertilization between commercial GM and non-GM maize crops in Uruguay was assessed. The methodology comprised field sampling and detection using DAS-ELISA and PCR. Five field-pair cases where GM maize crops were grown near non-GM maize crops were identified. These cases had the potential to cross-fertilize considering the distance between crops and the similarity of the sowing dates. Adventitious presence of GM material in the offspring of non-GM crops was found in three of the five cases. Adventitious presence of event MON810 or Bt11 in non-GM maize, which were distinguished using specific primers, matched the events in the putative sources of transgenic pollen. Percentages of transgenic seedlings in the offspring of the non-GM crops were estimated as 0.56%, 0.83% and 0.13% for three sampling sites with distances of respectively 40, 100 and 330 m from the GM crops. This is a first indication that adventitious presence of transgenes in non-GM maize crops will occur in Uruguay if isolation by distance and/or time is not provided. These findings contribute to the evaluation of the applicability of the ""regulated coexistence policy"" in Uruguay. © 2011 ISBR, EDP Sciences."

The WSN is composed of several nodes each provided with its separated power supply, e.g. battery. Working in hardly accessible places it is preferable to assure the adoption of the minimum transmission power in order to prolong as much as possible the WSN's lifetime. Though, we have to keep in mind that the reliability of the data transmitted represents a crucial requirement. Therefore, power optimization and reliability have become the most important concerns when dealing with modern systems based on WSN. In this context, we propose to evaluate the effectiveness of a Transmission Power Self-Optimization (TPSO) technique for WSNs in an Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Environment. The TPSO technique consists of an algorithm able to guarantee an equally high Quality of Service (QoS), concentrating on the WSN's Efficiency (Ef), while optimizing the transmission power necessary for data communication. Thus, the main idea behind our approach is to reach a trade-off between Ef and energy consumption in an environment with inherent noise. © 2010 IEEE."

The sample freezing point was estimated utilizing thermodynamic principles and the shelf temperature was set just below this value. The total chamber pressure was adjusted according to the water vapor pressure above ice, and the process time during main and final drying were estimated considering both the amount of water to be removed from each sample and the rate of heat transferred by contact and radiation from the surroundings.

The use of US echoes in human body has been stimulated after World War II, due to the high development in sonar and radar technologies. In 1940 a supersonic reflectoscope is presented to the world by F. Firestone, using basic transmission and reception of the echoes in order to locate defects in metals [1]. The Dussik brothers (Karl Theodore and Friederich Dussik) were the first clinicians to utilize US as a diagnostic tool. They tried to localize brain tumors in brain ventricles by through-transmission US attenuation image. Dussik published his first paper in 1942 and his additional conclusions after the II World War, in 1947. Since then, US applications have been intensely developed. Different imaging properties were proposed (linear and three-dimensional arrays, dynamic focusing, dynamic apodization, etc.). Consequently, there was an increase in the variety of US imaging modes (A-mode, B-mode, M-mode, Doppler, 3D US, etc.). Even so, diagnostic image analysis from US is not a trivial task. The ultrasound (US) operator (specialist) needs high training and skill levels to acquire and interpret the image displayed [2]. The received echo is the result of a series of scattering and reflections of the propagated pulse along a complex medium: the biological tissue. This medium can undergo subtle and acoustically similar changes for different pathologies which may add extra difficulties to the elaboration of a diagnosis. This is the case, for example, of diffuse liver diseases (fibrosis, cirrhosis and steatosis) which stages cannot be easily differentiated only by visual inspection of US images. Consequently, some vital information, in special regarding initial pathological stages, can be inadequately discarded [3]. To address this issue, in the last three decades, investigators have been using essentially spectral analysis methods to evaluate the US radiofrequency (RF) signal (and its envelope), to extract quantitative information about tissue structure, in an attempt to obtain a more effective diagnostic tool. Thus, the so called quantitative ultrasound (QUS) proposes parameters to characterize tissue conditions based on the assumption that diseases change the acoustic properties of the medium. The most common parameters found in literature are US propagation speed, attenuation and backscatter coefficients, mean scatterer spacing (periodicity), and scatterers size [4-14]. This chapter aims to present an overview of the basics of US imaging systems (operation characteristics, advantages, limitations, etc.) for medical diagnosis and some signal processing methods currently used for tissue characterization.

Hydrogen is the ideal medium for wind and electric energy storage. Although hydrogen is the most abundant element in nature, it requires energy for its production, because it seldom occurs free. Pure hydrogen is obtained by water electrolysis. It is for that reason that in the Mercosur regions the ideal scenario that must be exploited is the combination of two elements, wind and hydrogen, inasmuch as the use of fuel cells allows obtaining steady electric energy in isolated places from wind energy, which is intermittent. Methods for obtaining hydrogen by the reforming of natural gas or biofuel with very good results are also being developed. Therefore, the present work focuses on both studies and research on hydrogen energy and its beneficial consequences in relation to renewable and non-renewable resources, and to the mitigation of the environmental impact during its use. The multidisciplinary character of this work has allowed approaching it from a basic and also technological aspect considering different possibilities, such as electricity generation in fuel cells and hydrogen production using wind energy, and their impact on the region."

When applying a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system along a multi-actor supply chain, additional research questions are generated since it is commonly used at the single firm and actor level. Analysing the actor incentives, or the absence of thereof, to adopt QAS becomes a key question. Transaction costs analysis is introduced to better understand full (additional) QAS costs and possible governance structures between the chain actors. Results from actor surveys in 4 Southern Cone countries show that transaction costs and governance structures of the supply chain may constitute a limitation when transparency and uncertainty issues arise as a characteristic of transactions along the chain. These results suggest that in this scenario a third party intervention is needed when promoting the adoption of HACCP system. This intervention should be orientated to reduce the uncertainty across the chain as well as become a tool to generate an efficient transmission of quality incentives. © Wageningen Academic Publishers The Netherlands, 2007."

Image analysis of such data poses a challenging problem due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratios that makes individual volumes simply too noisy to allow reliable structural interpretation. This requires using averaging techniques to boost the signal-to-noise ratios, a common practice in electron microscopy single particle analysis where they have proven to be very powerful in elucidating high resolution structure. Although there are significant similarities in the way data is processed, several new problems arise in the tomography case that have to be properly dealt with. Such problems involve dealing with the missing wedge characteristic of limited angle tomography, the need for robust and efficient 3D alignment routines, and design of mediods that account for diverse conformations through the use of classification. We present a framework for reconstruction via alignment, classification and averaging of volumes obtained from limited angle electron tomography, providing a powerful tool for high resolution structure determination and description of conformational variability in a biological context. © 2007 IEEE."

For this, a semantic refiner is proposed This refiner acts as a specialist in information sciences and prepares, using linguistic resources, an appropriate search strategy that represents the user's information need. The semantic refinement consists on three steps. First, it guides the user for sense disambiguation of the words submitted by him. Then, it allows the user to select concepts hierarchically related to reduce the amount of documents to retrieve. Finally, it expands semantically concepts to increase the amount of documents to be retrieved.

Twenty-eight stations were explored during two surveys that took place in the 2003 austral spring (November and December). Surface water samples were collected for chl-a, plankton taxonomy, plankton flow cytometry, and absorption by CDOM and suspended particles. Radiometry was measured with both above-water SIMBAD and below-water Li-Cor PAR radiometers. SeaWiFS-derived chl-a values were obtained using NASA's OC4V4 bio-optical algorithm. A systematic overestimation of chl-a by SeaWiFS was observed, especially in the complex estuarine waters, by 110% on average, and was largely attributed to the bio-optical algorithm, not the atmospheric correction scheme. The overestimation was most dramatic in two areas: the mouth of the Río de la Plata and the external region of the continental shelf. In the Río de la Plata estuary, large CDOM absorption seemed to explain the discrepancies. Interestingly, in the surface waters of the outer edge of the continental shelf a conspicuous change in the phytoplankton composition was detected at two contiguous stations. A complete lack of diatoms and dinoflagellates was reported at those stations, and cocoid forms (<2μm) dominated phytoplankton composition (99%). The flow cytometry data also exhibited some peculiar features, i.e., pronounced peaks in picoplankton (0.2-2μm) abundance. At one of the two stations, relatively large specific absorption by particles contributed to chl-a overestimation by the SeaWiFS biooptical algorithm."

The filter is matched at some frequency between the third and the seventh harmonic, but currents wider spectrum of frequency will flow trough the filter. Peak and rms voltages, each on individual capacitor will vary with harmonic, difference of phase, and amplitude. These variations will depend on load operation and may go over capacitor ratings, diminishing the equipment life. As potential transformers are generally not installed in each capacitor set, a new type of current relay that computes the voltage from the current through the filter was developed. Errors and typical waveforms are shown. Settings of peak and rms voltage adjustments are discussed. The relay can be successfully used in shunt capacitor banks also. © 2004 IEEE."

This method differs from traditional methods of averaging losses across customers regardless of location, time of use, or the marginal contribution of net power injection/withdrawal positions to losses. With respect to distributed generation (DG) resources, nodal prices provide more efficient price signals for dispatch and siting decisions. Moreover, nodal prices provide greater economic incentives for the deployment of DG by rewarding DG resources for contributions toward reducing losses at the margin through changed power flows. Nodal pricing factors are calculated using power flows locating ""the reference bus"" at the power supply point where the transmission network connects to the distribution network. We assume no network constraints at the distribution level. Finally, we conclude with an application of this method in a rural radial distribution network."

Whereas TNO orbital element probability densities are complicated, the projected distributions of their sky-plane uncertainties are often unambiguous. However, following the last observation, ephemeris uncertainty grows almost linearly with time, making follow-up in subsequent apparitions tedious, if not impossible. Statistical ranging has the option of applying filters by imposing a priori information on the orbital element distributions, which results in smaller ephemeris uncertainty and focuses searches into the most likely regions on the sky. We illustrate the successful use of our technique. We are developing both an optimized observing strategy for maximum improvement in orbital accuracy using a minimum number of observations, and a web-based application."

The constraint approach reveals particularly useful for this type of rules, as decisions can be taken under the hypothesis of non existence of the excluded categories. If these categories are finally deduced, all other categories inferred upon the non existence of the former ones are automatically eliminated.

Such networks do not exhibit: saturated behaviour in the sense of extremely fast rates and/or insensitivity to input variations, as artificial systems with positive feedback generally do. It is therefore important to identify how intrinsic neuronal properties prevent saturation. The simplest circuit where this can be investigated is formed by a single neuron thai excites itself directly, and was analyzed experimentally by Diez-Martínez and Segundo (1983) using the pacemaker neuron of the crayfish stretch receptor organ. They showed that the system remained sensitive to variations in the input and suggested that neuronal adaptation along rapid successive firing played an important rote in this. We tested this hypothesis by modelling the same system. In a previous publication, using four neuron models of increasing complexity, we showed that for a fixed constant input and several transmission delays, providing adaptation was implemented, the model displayed dynamics reminiscent of the experimental data. In this publication, we extend previous investigations by estimating, for a fixed delay, a transfer function of the system defined as the relationship between the constant input and the mean firing rate of the model, We show that when adaptation is implemented saturation occurs only at larger inputs and/or larger EPSPs. Our study is therefore compatible with the hypothesis that neuronal adaptation may be important in preventing saturation."

The substrate temperature was prefixed from 200 to 250 °C. Film thickness was measured by transmission of 59.5 keV radiation from 241Am giving values from 35 to 50 μm (5%). Optical microscopy was performed to the films for determining crystallinity and grain size. Films were characterized by X-ray diffraction and texture was calculated as [ΣI (0 0 l)] / [ΣI (h k l)]. Correlations between grain size, crystallinity and growth preferred orientation with c axis perpendicular to the substrate with substrate temperature were confirmed. Epitaxy of the films strongly increases with substrate temperature, and films with texture of about 90% were obtained. Correlation between starting material purity and stoichiometry with epitaxial growth were also found. For measuring electrical and X-ray response properties detectors were assembled by front palladium thermal deposition, palladium wire attachment and acrylic encapsulation. Resistivities of 5 × 1014 Ω.cm and current densities of 5 pA/cm2 at 30 V were obtained. X-ray film response was checked by irradiating with an X-ray beam, giving linear response with exposure rate and sensitivities of about 0.35 μC/R.cm2. Again a correlation between electrical properties with the substrate temperature and epitaxial growth was confirmed. Finally, results were compared with previous ones for the same and alternative materials."

One hundred and ten samples of commercial wines were tested, originating from the 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999 harvests. Tannat wines showed medium contents of total polyphenols, while anthocyanins, flavonoids, o-diphenols and proanthocyanidins were significantly higher than wines made from the other varieties. The values of the Glories color indexes and the CIELAB chromatic variables of Tannat wines were significantly different from Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. However, statistical differences between the Cabernet Sauvignon and the Merlot were observed only in the blue color proportions. There were no statistical differences among the total phenolic contents of the wines produced from the different harvests. The polyphenolic and chromatic profile of the wines of each variety appeared to be characteristic, rather than the influence of the year of the harvest and the vinification process used in each case."

In a previous paper, Piedra Cueva (1933), a theory for linear water waves propagating in a two layered viscoelastic fluid system was described. The mass transport in the mud layer and in the water boundary layer is obtained solving the momentum and mass conservation equations in the Lagrangian coordinate system. It was found that the Eulerian coordinate system is not appropriate because it does not guarantee the continuity of the mass transport velocity through the water-mud interface. The results show that the mass transport velocity can be increased one order of magnitude in relation to the velocity given by the rigid bed theory and can be opposite to the wave propagation direction, depending on the physical mud properties. This result is very important when considering near bed sediment transport."

Poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) was chosen for its similar response to collagen and a segmented poly(ester urethane) (PHD) was used to introduce elastomeric properties through its elastin-like behavior. A bilayered electrospun conduit with two different PLLA/PHD blends was fabricated by mimicking the natural collagen-to-elastin ratio in the media and adventitia layers. The biomimetic mechanical response, compliance and elastic modulus were studied under pulsated pressure conditions.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene postconsumer bottles were immersed in an alkaline medium of a 1-M solution of sodium hydroxide and portland cement paste. Then, the fibers' surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This study showed that the fibers have a progressive surface deterioration over time when immersed in either of the two media. Degradation of fibers immersed in pozzolan-portland cement pastes was also observed. The results from the degradation process of these fibers show that it was stronger when they were immersed in the portland cement system (pH = 12.9), although the pH value was lower than that of the NaOH solution (pH = 13.8), suggesting that the degradation process in portland cement also depends on the formation of solid hydration products. The preliminary results of this study show overall good behavior of the studied fibers. This behavior generally improves when using pozzolans. Considering that fibers and pozzolans are obtained from wastes, and therefore have low economic and environmental costs, the possibility of using these materials in developing countries should be considered. The use of these wastes would, on the one hand, improve the properties of construction materials, and on the other, enable proper management of waste that could otherwise eventually pollute the environment. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers."

The gaps of mono and dual doped graphene decay with respect to unit cell size following a curve of the form βNα. The exponent has a small variation and an average value of −3/2. The pre-exponential term presents a larger dispersion as the heteroatom is changed. In some cases, such as Si-doped graphene, the gaps could not be fitted to the aforementioned type of curve because the gaps are close to zero. Using these curves for P-doped graphene, we estimated that for a unit cell with 5000 atoms, one P atom is expected to open a gap close to 0.05 eV, as indicated by HSE calculations. The effective masses of holes and electrons also follow a curve of the form βNα, as the unit cell is increased. Yet, in contrast with the results obtained for gaps, the exponents determined for Si, P and S doped graphene exhibit a larger variation. For dual-doped graphene, the introduction of a second dopant to P-doped graphene (namely, B or N), decreases the effective masses. This result suggests that dual-doped graphene is an interesting material to develop graphene based electronic devices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

In fact, its design was conceived before the development of reinforced concrete. Therefore, the construction materials and processes have evolved to adapt new technologies without compromising the vision of Gaudí. This willingness to maintain the original designs has obliged the technicians to resolve details that were not defined in the project, including the issue of how to cast elements at great heights and with a high amount of reinforcement. In this context, the possibility of using self-compacting concrete (SCC) emerged.

Their morphological, structural, optical, electrochemical and photoelectrochemical features were studied in depth. Morphology of samples can be tuned from a near vertically and dense 1D nanostructure to a quasi 2D film according the value of the SCN– /Cu2+ molar ratio (r) present in the electrochemical bath. Raman studies confirmed the nature of CuSCN in its beta phase. For low r values CuSCN NRs presented high preferential orientation along the c-axis and high optical scattering at low wavelengths which lead to both low haze and high integrated diffuse reflectance. Band gap values were also affected by the r value thus experiencing a redshift, probably related to both quantum confinement and light dispersion. Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements confirmed the p-type behavior of samples together with the enhancement of their surface at low r values.

This task is particularly difficult for nanotubes, where the exhibited surface curvature is a limitation for its study. We present the synthesis and thorough structural characterization through several experimental techniques for morphology and compositional characterization. Simulated X-rays powder diffraction patterns (XRPD) of real size nanotubes models are refined with experimental data. The building blocks for the TNT models were obtained from computational simulations by means of Density Functional Theory for H2Ti2O5·0.5H2O, H2Ti2O5·H2O, H2Ti3O7 and H2Ti3O7·0.67H2O. Our procedure confirms that open‐ended TNTs are obtained, with ∼100 nm of length and 6(1) nm of inner diameter. By interpreting the XRPD data, the TNT building block was obtained and found to derive from H2Ti3O7, where the distance between [TiO6] octahedral layers is increased in accordance with H2Ti3O7·0.67H2O.

Different parameters are taken into account in determining the minimum demoulding time, but the only one that is always taken into account is concrete temperature. Therefore, a methodology for determining the minimum demoulding times for vertical elements of self-compacting concrete (SCC) based on maturity functions is studied. Maturity functions establish a relationship between maturity and in-situ resistance. While maturity may be measured by measuring the temperature over time, there are different option for determining resistance in-situ, and thus the objective of this work is focused on methods for measuring resistance at early ages. An experimental study was carried out to establish which method for determining resistance in-situ is best suited to the determination of the resistance-maturation curve. To that end, the suitability and consistency of each method were studied. In addition, an experimental validation of the methodology was carried out, in which the demoulding methodology was applied to 11 columns tested at a construction site.

We performed a structural characterization from the micro to the subnanoscopic scale by means of scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and time-differential perturbed γ-γ angular correlation (PAC) spectroscopy. The results show the formation of the cubic bixbyite structure after a thermal treatment at 1473 K. For the synthesized 181Ta-doped Y2O3, the PAC experiments demonstrate that the impurities are mainly located at both substitutional cationic sites of the bixbyite structure. The experimental investigation was complemented by performing first-principles electronic structure calculations for Ta atoms localized at the two cationic sites of the Y2O3 semiconductor structure, which allow the study of the structural and electronic modifications induced in the host system when the impurities are introduced. These calculations confirm that the measured electric-field gradients for the synthesized 181Ta-doped Y2O3 correspond to double-ionized impurities located at substitutional defect-free cationic sites of the bixbyite host structure and indicate the site occupancy preference for 181Hf(→181Ta) doping. The behaviour of the site preference of 181Ta impurities with temperature is also discussed.

Due to the mix design, this type of concrete does not require any vibration method and can be filled continuously without presenting segregation. Therefore, high placement rates (over 10 m/h) are common practice today. The aim of this work is to develop a statistical model that predicts the maximum lateral pressure exerted by SCC on vertical formwork. However, considering the conditions of placement, for this type of concrete on real constructions, another principal objective of the model is to obtain an accurate prediction of the maximum lateral pressure when SCC is poured at placement rates of over 10 m/h. The model takes into account seven of the variables that affect the lateral pressure of fresh concrete: placement rate, slump flow, height of the concrete piece, concrete temperature, cement type, minimum dimension and size of the cross section. 131 experimental data were collected from the literature and were considered for the formulation of the model. In addition, a survey was conducted with 105 construction managers from different companies in over 20 countries. The results show that the model presents a very good approximation to the experimental data, especially for high placement rates. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

It is shown that the uniform exponential stability, of a switched linear system in this class, can be determined by means of the spectral radii of a given finite set of matrices associated to the system. It is also proved that the uniform exponential stability, in this class of switched linear systems, can be characterized in terms of the feasibility of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) associated to the given system (and equivalently, it can also be characterized in terms of the feasibility of a set of linear inequalities associated to the system). A constructive converse Lyapunov theorem, for uniformly exponentially stable switched linear systems in this class, is also included in the last characterization. It establishes that a uniformly exponentially stable switched linear system (in this class) always has a convex common Lyapunov function that is represented by as many quadratic functionals as modes composing the switched system. The reported results show that, for this class of switched linear systems, the uniform exponential stability can be determined in a computationally efficient manner.

One of the main constraints when implementing SC Sigma-Delta ADCs for high sampling rates is the requirement for the transition frequency and settling behavior of the operational transconductance amplifier. Extensive analysis has been carried out concerning the settling time, however an optimum regarding the distribution between the slew and linear periods is yet to be defined. The gm/ID method is used to sweep the design space of an OTA in order to find a minimum in power consumption thus an optimum slew/linear distribution. The method is validated through the design of three 2.5ns settling time OTAs for two design scenarios with different slew/linear distribution in a 130nm CMOS process. Results show that consumption savings of up to 60% are achieved when compared to the optimum design. © 2017 IEEE."

However, the use of colored fringe patterns leads to a mayor problem, the color cross-talk, which has been considered to be equivalent to reconstructing the phase map from the fringe patterns with unknown phase shifts. Therefore, phase error is introduced when conventional phase-shifting algorithms with fixed phase shift values are used to retrieve the phase. To overcome the cross-talk issue, we propose the use of a fringe pattern normalization algorithm to achieve the intensity modulation balance among the different color channels and then the use of an advanced iterative algorithm to retrieve the phase.

Studies below room temperature show two principal mechanisms: one broad peak, similar to β relaxation, and another sharp peak, similar to α relaxation. This observation suggests that the interaction between amorphous structure and mechanical waves demonstrates that β′ relaxation can be decomposed in two principal peaks, one due to the movement of flow units and another owing to the growth of molecular-like structures. The behaviour of hybridization among Al-Cu atoms tends to decrease the free space in the amorphous matrix, increasing internal friction. The mechanical excitation and interaction among nanostructures such as cluster type, supercluster and molecular-like structure, can lead to growth of microalloy which may give rise to the medium-range order structure as well as increasing the small nanocrystalline region scattered into the glassy structure. In addition, the effect of mechanical vibration and cryogenic temperature acting on the amorphous structure can promote interaction among nanostructures resulting in a barrier that tends to block the propagation of shear bands in the metallic glasses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

In comparison to purely digital methods, the attractiveness of optical processors for pattern recognition lies in their highly parallel operation and real-time processing capability. This work presents an optical implementation of the generalized Hough transform (GHT), a well-established technique for recognition of geometrical features in binary images. Detection of a geometric feature under the GHT is accomplished by mapping the original image to an accumulator space; the large computational requirements for this mapping make the optical implementation an attractive alternative to digital-only methods. We explore an optical setup where the transformation is obtained, and the size and orientation parameters can be controlled, allowing for dynamic scale and orientation-variant pattern recognition. A compact system for the above purposes results from the use of an electrically tunable lens for scale control and a pupil mask implemented on a high-contrast spatial light modulator for orientation/shape variation of the template. Real-time can also be achieved. In addition, by thresholding of the GHT and optically inverse transforming, the previously detected features of interest can be extracted. © 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)."

In this work, we propose to use LSA in order to infer similarity degree of syslog messages by discovering hidden relations between them. Using real syslog message samples, we show that LSA is able to highlight the most correlated messages by topic. This method can be used to avoid complex event correlation systems which usually need signatures or rule set definitions and high expertise for its configuration. © 2017 IEEE."

Flores 2124-11800, Montevideo, Uruguay","Molybdenum is an essential trace element of biological and environmental relevance. Monitoring its content in water sources is very important from the standpoint of health and environment. Given the very low concentrations of Mo in water, it is necessary to use highly sensitive techniques such as ICP-MS or elaborate methods including preconcentration prior to detection. In this work, a new method for the determination of molybdenum in groundwater was developed, incorporating a preconcentration step based on dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) prior to detection by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). After the injection of a ternary mixture formed by an aqueous solution of the complexing agent (potassium ethyl xanthate) and extraction and dispersion solvents (carbon tetrachloride, acetonitrile), the formation of the Mo-xanthate complex occurs followed by its extraction in fine droplets of carbon tetrachloride. After separating the phases the molybdenum content is measured by ETAAS. Several experimental parameters were optimised and the method was validated, presenting a detection limit (3s/b) of 0.017 μg L-1, a quantification limit (10s/b) of 0.062 μg L-1, and an enrichment factor of 165 for a sample volume of 6.0 mL. The calibration curve was linear in the range of 0.06-1.1 μg L-1, the precision (repeatability, sr (%), n = 10) was 2.98% at 0.1 μg L-1 and the recovery of spiked samples was 98.5-103%. This method was successfully applied to the determination of molybdenum in groundwater and the results were found to be equivalent to those obtained by ICP-MS. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry."

The presence of moisture represents one of the major issues associated with structures fabricated with ceramic masonry. The intrinsic characteristic of the material along with the age of the structure plays an important role in the amount of moisture absorbed by the walls. Traditional methods for determining the moisture content of in-situ masonry walls are many times destructive or semi-destructive and provide limited information. In this study, ground penetrating radar is used as a non-destructive technique for measuring the moisture content in ceramic masonry walls. Control samples were used as calibration in the laboratory and field measurements were performed to determine the moisture content of the ceramic walls. The developed methodology was applied to real size ceramic walls, were in-situ measurements showed areas with different moisture levels. The methodology developed showed to be fast and easy to use in the field for measuring the moisture content of ceramic brick walls. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

The external circuit is built with off-the-shelf low-cost components and has low power consumption; the VHDL core uses very few on-chip resources. The complete system has an error lower than 1% in the FPGA power consumption measurement. As it can be triggered by internal complex conditions, it makes it possible to obtain detailed power consumption profiles of FPGA designs using a very simple procedure.

The effect of trabecular cutting was also analyzed with finite-element model (FEM) simulations. Our results demonstrated that LV compliance improved after trabecular cutting (p<0.001). Finite-element simulations further demonstrated that stiffer trabeculae reduce LV compliance further, and that the presence of trabeculae reduced the wall stress in the apex.

Although there are taxon dependent variations adapted to different environments, this multimodal system can be schematically described as having four main components: active electroreception, passive electroreception, lateral line sense and, proprioception. Amongst these sensory modalities, proprioception and electroreception show 'active' systems that extrct information carried by self generated forms of energy. This ensemble of four sensory modalities is present in African mormyriformes and American gymnotiformes. The convergent evolution of similar imaging, peripheral encoding, and central processing mechanisms suggests that these mechanisms may be the most suitable for dealing with electric images in the context of the other and self generated actions. This review deals with the way in which biological organisms address three of the problems that are faced when designing a bioinspired electroreceptive agent: (a) body shape, material and mobility, (b) peripheral encoding of electric images, and (c) early processing of electrosensory signals. Taking into account biological solutions I propose that the new generation of underwater agents should have electroreceptive arms, use complex peripheral sensors for encoding the images and cerebellum like architecture for image feature extraction and implementing sensory-motor transformations. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd."

Two three-dimensional models were created and assembled. All models were subjected to a natural masticatory force of 118 N in the angle of 75° to the occlusal plane. All degrees of freedom in the inferior border of the cortical bone were restrained, and the mesial and distal borders of the end of the bone section were constrained. Fatigue material data and loads were assumed as random variables. Maximum principal stresses on bone were evaluated. Then, the probability of failure was obtained by the probabilistic approach. The maximum principal stress distribution predicted in the cortical and trabecular bone is 32 MPa for external connection and 39 MPa for internal connection. A mean life of 103 and 210 million cycles were obtained for external and internal connection, respectively. Probability cumulative function was also evaluated for both connection types.

However, introduction of new applications over the years have brought about new requirements related with throughput, scalability, mobility, security, connectivity, and availability among others. Additionally, convergence of telecommunications, media, and information technology was responsible for transformation of the Internet into an integrated system enabling accessing, distributing, processing, storing, and managing the payload of these messages. Users are now visibly more interested in receiving / accessing information independently of the network location of its host. This consideration in turn revived the interest in named data-driven networking (a.k.a. Information-Centric Networking - ICN). Instead of assuming that networks are limited to the manipulation of network locator space, the basic assumption underneath is that information can be named, addressed, and matched independently of its network location leaving in turn the possibility to match message delivery delay requirements. In this paper, we summarize our research conducted in order to bring a completely different view / perspective of network resilience, originally defined as the ability of a network to assure an acceptable level of service in the face of various faults and challenges to normal operation. That is, instead of maintaining network reachability independently of its actual utility to the “end-points”, our research aimed at exchanging and confronting the key principles that would enable an information-driven resilience (networked) scheme. More precisely, knowing that the user utility function is mainly driven nowadays by information-related criteria such as accessibility (reachability), how to design network resilience schemes that would be directed toward that goal. The main challenge is thus: can one design resilience schemes that combine maximization of end-point utility function and minimization of the network-related cost? © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

The robot freely explores a limited laboratory area in the manner of a rat or mouse and reports information to a PC, thus enabling research without the use of live individuals. Position coordinate neural maps are achieved as mathematically predicted although for a reduced number of implemented neurons (i.e., 200 neurons). However, this type of computational embedded system (robot's microcontroller) is found to be insufficient for simulating huge numbers of neurons in real time (as in the medial entorhinal cortex). It is considered that the results of this work provide an insight into achieving an enhanced embedded systems design for emulating and understanding mathematical neural network models to be used as biologically inspired navigation system for robots. © 2017 J.

In order to develop several competencies in our students of Software Engineering courses, Calculus I at Universidad ORT Uruguay focuses on several competencies such as: synthesis, abstraction and problem solving (based on the ACM/IEEE Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Software Engineering). Every semester we reflect on our practice and try to answer the following research question: What kind of activities can we design in Calculus 1 to retain students and obtain better results? This paper explores students’ perspectives on creating an article based on IEEE conference format related to one of the course topics and present the work in class using a poster. Preliminary results show an increase in retention and significant differences in final course results compared with two control groups. Collaborative learning activities using online editing tools encourage students to become self-learners and our role as teacher changed from being the center of the class to becoming a moderator where the principal figures are the students. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017."

This study aimed (1) to characterize the arterial conduit (CF) and buffering (distensibility) function of the iliac arteries in in vivo animals, in which the intimal and adventitial layers were removed; (2) to determine the effects of intra-aortic ballon pumping (IABP) on simultaneously de-adventitialized (DA) and de-endothelialized (DE) iliac arteries before and after induced heart failure. Methods: Pressure and diameter signals were measured in the iliac arteries of sheep (n = 7) in which the adventitial and intima layer were removed. Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) assistance was used in a control state and after heart failure induction. Results: Both DE and DA determined significant changes in arterial diameter, distensibility and CF. Changes were higher after DA than after DE in terms of distensibility and CF (p<0.05). DA followed by DE (DA + DE) showed significant increases in arterial diameter and CF, accompanied by a decrease in distensibility (p<0.05) with respect to intact arteries. Heart failure induction caused significant hemodynamic changes without modifying the already impaired local biomechanical parameters. Nonsignificant improvements in the biomechanical parameters of DA + DE iliac arteries were observed during IABP before and after heart failure induction. Conclusions: Biomechanical changes caused by DA of iliac arteries were more important than those observed after DE. The DA + DE arteries showed significant differences with respect to intact arteries and with DA or DE arteries. IABP-related effects on arterial mechanics were absent in DA + DE arteries. © 2017 Wichtig Publishing."

This hematite nano-architecture has been tuned from a 1-D nanoporous layer (grown onto a bare iron foil substrate) to a high aspect self-organized nanotube one (grown onto a pretreated iron foil). Well-developed hematite nanotube arrays perpendicular to the substrate with a 1 μm in length have been obtained. The nanoporous sample was characterized by pores of a mean diameter of 30 nm and an interpore distance of 150 nm, whereas the self-organized nanotube layer consisted of nanotube arrays with a single tube inner diameter of approximately 50 nm and average spacing of approximately 90 nm. The wall thickness of the hematite nanotubes was of approximately 30 nm. A comparative study of the photoelectrochemical properties of these two different hematite nanostructures under water-splitting conditions have been studied through EIS and PEIS methods. The strong correlation between the CSS increase with the RSS,ct decrease and the photocurrent development as the potential is made more anodic, indicated that holes transfer for the water splitting reaction takes place through the surface states and not directly from valence band holes. From the PEIS spectra the rate constants of the elementary reactions responsible for the competing processes of interfacial charge transfer (ktr) and electron-hole recombination (krec) have been determined. A better photoresponse kinetic was observed from the hematite nanotubular structure as compared to the nanoporous one. The last indicates that in the hematite nanotubular structure it exists a very well length scale matching between the nanotube wall thickness and the hole diffusion length (maximize light absorption while maintaining the bulk within hole collection length), diminishing then the recombination processes.

This guide has selected a beam test (EN 14651) for the characterization of tensile constitutive behaviour of RFC. One drawback of the EN test is that, because of their shape, it almost impossible to apply the test to specimens extracted from an in-situ existing element. Some new compact tests (with small size specimens) that overcome this difficulty have been recently proposed, like the wedge splitting test (WST), the Barcelona test, or the Double Edge Wedge Splitting (DEWS) Test. Despite the advances, issues are still present in the new tests. In this work, preliminary results of a research where presented focusing a new test for the determination of residual strength parameters. The test is based in the WST, but changes are made over the load device and the specimen, aiming to achieve simplifications that allow it to be used in routine quality verification. A more simple, fast, and economic test was obtained, which can be performed in a simple displacement controlled testing machine (with no need of close-loop control). In this paper, the test is introduced, and the friction coefficient assessed. It was shown that a stable friction coefficient (l = 0.06) is obtained. This is a key aspect of the test, as the effective opening force applied to the sample is influenced by this value. Results suggest that this test is a potentially attractive, and should be explored to be used in routine control of the FRC. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018."

This problem is addressed as a whole by simultaneously scheduling the state of the servers and the cooling devices,and by scheduling the workload of the data center,which is comprised of a set of independent tasks with due dates. Its goal is to simultaneously minimize the energy consumption budget of the data center,the energy consumption deviation from a reference profile,and the amount of tasks whose due dates are violated. Two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms hybridized with a greedy heuristic are proposed and are enhanced by applying simulated annealing for post hoc optimization.

The problem consists in determining the time interval between subsequent vehicles for a given set of lines, taking into account interests of users and operators. The result of this stage is considered as input at the operational level. In general, the problem faced by planners is how to distribute a given fleet of buses among a set of given lines. The corresponding decisions determine the frequency of each line, which impacts directly on the waiting time of the users and operator costs. In this work, we consider frequency setting as the problem of minimizing simultaneously users' total travel time and fleet size, which represents the interest of operators. There is a trade-off between these two measures; therefore, we face a multi-objective problem. We extend an existing single-objective formulation to account explicitly for this trade-off, and propose a Tabu Search solving method to handle efficiently this multi-objective variant of the problem. The proposed methodology is then applied to a real medium-sized problem instance, using data of Puerto Montt, Chile. We consider two data sets corresponding to morning-peak and off-peak periods. The results obtained show that the proposed methodology is able to improve the current solution in terms of total travel time and fleet size. In addition, the proposed method is able to efficiently suggest (in computational terms) different trade-off solutions regarding the conflicting objectives of users and operators.

An NR method is employed at a reference node with optimal reception. In this node the video impairments are only due to the acquisition and the TV station coding process, since the received digital TV signal is the same as the broadcasted. An FR method runs at the other receiving nodes, located at different geographic spots, where signal can be hit by different patterns of packet losses due to the transmission process. The FR method compares the signal received at these nodes with the one received at the reference node.

The growing trend to interconnect national power grids to meet regional integration objectives, may lead to an increase in the size of the present energy transmission networks to form a sort of super-grid at continental scale. Such a broad and heterogeneous super-grid can be exposed to the effects of large GIC if appropriate mitigation actions are not taken into consideration. In the present study, we present GIC estimates for the Uruguayan HV power grid during severe magnetic storm conditions. The GIC intensities are strongly dependent on the rate of variation of the geomagnetic field, conductivity of the ground, power grid resistances and configuration. Calculated GIC are analysed as functions of these parameters. The results show a reasonable agreement with measured data in Brazil and Argentina, thus confirming the reliability of the model. The expansion of the grid leads to a strong increase in GIC intensities in almost all substations. The power grid response to changes in ground conductivity and resistances shows similar results in a minor extent. This leads us to consider GIC as a non-negligible phenomenon in South America. Consequently, GIC must be taken into account in mid-to-low latitude power grids as well. © 2016 COSPAR"

Blood pressure (BP) is one of the most relevant parameters used for continual monitoring of possible hypertension states in the elderly population. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that central blood pressure is a more accurate predictor of future cardiovascular events than brachial pressure, thus potentially providing a better hemodynamic determinant for clinical outcomes. This work presents a non-invasive Central (Aortic) blood pressure estimation method based on the pulse transit time (ptt) principle estimated from electrocardiogram (ECG) and ballistocardiogram (BCG) recordings. As the measured transit time presented takes place mainly within the aortic domain, we estimate aortic blood pressure instead of brachial pressure. Validation of the proposed method was performed with a small sample of healthy volunteers at a local gym. An Atcor Medical SphygmoCor device was used to monitor central and brachial blood pressure (systolic, mean, and diastolic) during rests of the strength maneuvers. Pulse transit time was estimated from ECG and BCG recordings and simultaneously recorded with all BP readings. Results showed that Systolic and Mean central blood pressures were most strongly correlated with ppt-estimated blood pressure in comparison to all other blood pressure readings; Bland-Altman plots showed an almost zero mean error (|μ|< 0.02mmHg) and bounded standard deviation σ< 5mmHg for all systolic and mean central BP readings. Experimental data, thus showed promissory results for monitoring aortic blood pressure via ptt. The scope of this pilot work is to provide initial validation of this method in order to develop a compact miniaturized device that allows the integration of wireless blood pressure monitoring into a wearable system. © 2016, IUPESM and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Its resolution has been one of the main subjects in Computer Graphics, which has led to the development of methods focused on different goals. For instance, in inverse lighting problems, it is convenient to solve the radiosity equation thousands of times for static geometries. Also, this calculation needs to consider many (or infinite) light bounces to achieve accurate global illumination results. Several methods have been developed to solve the linear system by finding approximations or other representations of the radiosity matrix, because the full storage of this matrix is memory demanding. Some examples are hierarchical radiosity, progressive refinement approaches, or wavelet radiosity, which may become slow for many bounces. Recently, new direct methods have been developed based on matrix factorization. This paper introduces a novel and efficient error-bounded factorization method based on the use of multiple singular value decompositions and the Z-order curve to sort the patches of the model. This technique accelerates the factorization of in-core matrices, and allows to work with out-of-core matrices passing only one time over them. Using this method, the inverse of the radiosity matrix can be efficiently approximated, reducing the memory and time resources needed to compute radiosity with infinite bounces. In the experimental analysis, the presented method is applied to scenes up to 163 K patches. After a precomputation stage, it is used to solve the radiosity problem for fixed geometries at interactive times. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

Several studies have shown that the lower the mismatches regarding mechanical or functional properties between the native vessel and its vascular substitute, the lower the hemodynamic alterations. From a theoretical point of view, the best substitutes have similar characteristics to the tissue or organ to be replaced. In the present work, samples of electrospun nanofibrous Poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular grafts were subjected to pulsated pressure conditions using an experimental setup. Graft dynamic response was obtained from experimental measurements applying an ultrasonic gold standard method (to measure graft diameter) and a high frequency response pressure transducer (to obtain intraluminal pressure). Similarly, femoral and carotid arteries of normotensive male control subjects and ambulatory male patients with mild to moderate hypertension were explored in vivo in order to relate their mechanical performance to that observed in the synthetic grafts. The obtained results verified the existence of important biomechanical differences between vascular grafts and human arteries. Under normal physiological conditions, the pressure-strain modulus (106dyn/cm2) of ePTFE and PLLA (1095 ± 21.5 and 12.4 ± 1.47, respectively) resulted significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than the carotid and femoral modulus values (4.47 ± 1.36 and 5.9 ± 1.42, respectively). During the hypertensive condition (higher pressure levels) ePTFE and PLLA increased their elasticity values to 1136 ± 21.6 and 15.97 ± 2.6, respectively, with respect to an increase of 9.27 ± 3.59 and 15.70 ± 5.96 of carotid and femoral arteries. Additionally, the elastic mismatch generated by the interposition of both grafts between native arteries (carotid or femoral) was quantified by means of computational simulations. PLLA tubular structures manifested a mechanical behavior that mimics the response to pulsatile hypertensive pressure regimes (the lowest reflection coefficient was observed) which constitutes a highly desired property for vascular tissue-engineered scaffold production. © 2016, IUPESM and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

The typical problem in the area is to find the probability that the resulting random graph is connected( or more generally, that a given subset K of nodes belong to the same connected component), called reliability. Although (and because) the exact reliability computation belongs to the class of NP-Hard problems, the literature offers many methods for this purpose, given the importance of the models. This paper deals with diameter-constrained reliability, a similar metric defined in 2001, inspired by delay-sensitive applications in telecommunications, where terminals are required to be connected by d hops or less, for a given positive integer d called diameter. Factorization theory is one of the fundamental tools of classical network reliability, and today it is a mature area. However, its extension to the diameter-constrained context requires at least the recognition of irrelevant links, which is an open problem. In this paper, irrelevant links are efficiently determined in the most basic and, by far, used case, the source-terminal one, where K = 2, thus providing a first step towards a Factorization theory in diameter constrained reliability.

The approach incorporates the variability of both the components and their interactions, identifies the conditions for the arrival of extreme values and bounds the uncertainty in the results. The outcome of the method is an “extended Davenport peak factor” (EDPF) that relates the descriptors of the resultant, the parameters of the distribution function of the peaks, and the probability of not exceeding a given threshold. The method was applied to the analysis of the extreme wind actions on a parabolic trough. The model parameters were expressed in terms of 3 magnitudes which characterize the spatial (correlation), temporal (frequency of peaks) and intrinsic (variance) variability of the actions. The results are consistent with methods that consider the variability of the components and the variability that is introduced by their combination. Nonetheless, the methods that do not incorporate this information result in peak factors that are an average of 13% lower. Also, the methods for Gaussian variables do not capture the variability between the case studies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

Here, in addition to the desirable throughput efficiency, it is important to ensure a level of rate reciprocity between peers, an issue that has been studied before only for wired networks. For the wireless substrate efficiency and reciprocity may be in conflict, due to the non-uniform link capacities of different peering choices, and the possible interference between them. We use convex optimization to formulate a relevant tradeoff, measuring reciprocity through a Kullback-Leibler divergence between sent and received rates. We propose decentralized methods which involve peer-to-peer interactions, and are shown to converge to the corresponding tradeoff point. Illustrative simulations are provided. © 2013 IEEE."

It provides the protection and monitoring devices of a busbar with synchronized digital samples of voltages and currents that are collected at the bays and communicated across the power substation (PS). One major deterrent for the implementation of the PB is the absence of a standard technology for the coordination of time sources within the PS. Proprietary IRIG-B and pulse-per-second (PSS) coordination schemes have been developed, which do not take advantage of the ethernet deployed for the PB. The precision time protocol (PTP) offers a packet-based solution for synchronization, but does not capitalize on the full information provided by the multiple PS clocks, and it suffers of the time-jump effect when grandmasters are switched. We propose a coordination method to average time references in a PS of campus scale, utilizing components of the PTP standard for interoperability and legacy compatibility. The main novelty of the paper is the incorporation of sparsity-aware statistical tools for outlier rejection that result in an automatic rule to include or discard the references received from each master clock. © 2016 IEEE."

These walls consist of two bonded concrete layers, the first, a conventional Reinforced Concrete (RC) diaphragm wall, and the second, a Sprayed Steel Fibre Reinforced Concrete (SFRC). The main objective of this paper is to analyze the structural and sectional behaviour of these walls. A study in the form of an uncoupled structuralsection analysis based on various hypothetical cases of bi-layer diaphragm walls was performed to fulfil the objective. It is concluded that there exists a potential of reduction in the reinforcement of the RC layer through the structural use of the SFRC layer. However, when the reduction is quantified, even though a reduction of between 3.2% and 1.7% in the RC reinforcement is confirmed, it appears insufficient to offer a cost-effective solution.

(2008a) showed that, counterintuitively, the wind speeds in the passage of diverging configurations is higher compared to converging configurations. Blocken et al. focused on the wind climate at pedestrian level. The results of this new study show that from the ground to the roof level the wind speeds in the passage are increasing with increasing angles between the buildings for the converging cases, while they are decreasing for the diverging cases. For all cases the highest turbulent kinetic energies can be found downstream of the passage. For the converging cases these regions are located downstream of the buildings and mostly above the pedestrian level, while for diverging cases these regions are located between the buildings at the pedestrian level, where the probability that pedestrians are present is higher. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

These experiments are usually conducted in ocean wave tanks. The wave focalization using time reversal is a well-known technique in the field of acoustics. It was proved using several physical waves, but was not experimentally tested in ocean wave in the scale of a wave tank. For this purpose, the tank of the University of São Paulo was used for these experiments. The tank has 148 flaps equipped with wave probes for control feedback of active wave absorption. Hence, the waves can be recorded and re-emitted by the flaps. The time reversal technique is here experimentally evaluated in order to generate focused waves in water tests. First, a small object dropping into the tank water acts as a source of impulsive wave for time reversal experiments. In a second experiment, a reflective wall is introduced into the tank, in order to distort the wave propagation and generate wave reverberations. The results show the ability of the time reversal technique to focalize impulsive waves back at the origin, even in the case of obstacles to the wave propagation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

In this paper we propose a new and fast daylighting method that allows to perform opening shape optimizations. The base of our method is to model each element of an opening surface as a pinhole and then formulate a compact irradiance-based representation to ease global illumination calculations. We use the UDI metric to evaluate our method, on an office-based model, for different orientations and different geographical locations, showing that optimal windows shapes can be obtained in short times.

It was designed to collect and process information for broadcasters and regulatory bodies, in order to control and improve the quality of the delivered signal in its service area, which is in turn a factor to boost the adoption of DTV by the users. The system continuously measures the signal's RF parameters and transport stream characteristics at many places, using a common time base, in order to assess continuously and automatically the perceived quality, instead of measuring on request of users or broadcasters, when problems are experienced. The article describes the architecture of the system, which is distributed, scalable and very low cost, and shows a functional evaluation of the prototype deployment. Special attention is given to the quality models that emulate the human perception for audio and video, considering both non reference and full reference models. The system is modular, in such a way that different quality models may be used, independently from the acquisition, transmission and recording of quality parameters functionality. © 2016 IEEE."

The migration to the Cloud may be accompanied by the revision of the business process, to integrate tasks over big data. In this way, existing workflow implementations may be extended with calls to operations in Hadoop or other tools. In this work, we define a framework to implement business process over heterogeneous technologies. Our framework is based on a novel workflow engine, called μBP-AM. Workflow execution in μBP-AM is performed by successively transforming the graph obtained from a workflow definition. μBP-AM has a formal semantics, which gives a precise definition of how the workflow is implemented. μBP-AM is at the core of an extensible framework capable of supporting not only Web service operations but also Hadoop operation calls (among others). The tool described here was conceived to increase reliability and to promote interoperability. We describe a prototype implementation of our framework, as well as some experimental results. Experiments using this prototype show that compositions run in μBP-AM using about the same resources as those run by using other tools. © 2015 IEEE."

The technique consists of exciting the tissue or organ to be analyzed with an external mechanical low frequency pulse and detecting the displacements of each small region of tissue when receiving the shear wave. This is done by obtaining the records of the echographic signals of the region analyzed with a transducer ultrasound. The speckle interferometry of the Ascan signals is then performed. Thus the displacement produce by the shear wave of the each small region of tissue is determined. In this way a map of the shear wave velocity is obtained across the scanned area. The Young's modulus of the analyzed region is computed from this velocity value.

These networks allow a highly flexible approach to data monitoring and, consequently, a major breakthrough for several application domains, from industrial control applications to large building domotics and health care applications. One of the major impairments of using wireless networks to support critical monitoring applications is the electromagnetic noise, which may increase the packet loss ratio to unacceptable values. In this paper, we assess different techniques of cooperative communication and network coding that can be useful to mitigate the aforementioned problem. These techniques may be implemented in WSN nodes in conformance with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, to reduce the impact of electromagnetic interferences upon the packet loss ratio. In this paper, we report an experimental assessment of the network coding and cooperative diversity techniques, where the network is subjected to a controlled electromagnetic interference inside of an anechoic chamber. The experimental results show that, by using these techniques, it is possible to increase the success rate of communication in typical electromagnetic noisy environments. © 2016 IEEE."

National rice production and crop management records were used to estimate energy, nitrogen, water, and carbon footprints and agrochemical contamination risk for the rice phase of typical rice-pasture rotations in Uruguay. Results suggest that increases in national production were achieved with simultaneous increases in net energy yield and water use efficiency (56% and 41%, respectively). Although carbon footprint per unit of production decreased (-30%), potential nitrogen losses increased (37%) and elevated agrochemical contamination risk occurred in specific years. This study highlights the potential role of improved agronomy in balancing food production and environmental goals, while also indicating that similar holistic assessments are needed for other rice growing regions to better evaluate SI strategies and quantify potential tradeoffs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

For this purpose, it is important not only to classify the faults, but also to understand the different faulty behaviors. When an embedded system is considered, a common approach for analyzing the faulty behavior is to exploit the execution trace features often available in medium to high size processors. This paper proposes two IP modules intended to facilitate fault injection experiments in small processor systems: a memory saboteur and a bus event recorder. The former allows the injection of SEU and stuck-at faults, both at a specific memory location and at the address or data bus level. The latter provides an alternative to the use of a full execution trace solution, which is often not available in small processors. The IP blocks were used to inject the faults and to analyze the behavior of a submodule of an implantable pulse generator running on an FPGA-hosted openMSP430 processor system. The IP blocks, the fault injection environment and the results of the fault injection campaigns are presented. The event traces captured by the event recorder IP played a fundamental role to understand the faulty behavior. © 2016 IEEE."

Todays cryptography still requires encrypted data to be decrypted before it can be searched. We propose here an alternative way of protecting the privacy of data through dispersion of a compressed version of the original data that can be searched without recovering the original data. Our scheme compresses the original data and then generates several chunks that are stored at different nodes. The chunks are stored in the form of an index. To search for a string, we convert the string into chunks with the same scheme and then have each site consult its index in order to obtain a list of all possible positions where the search string might be found. These local results are then sent to the user who performs a logical intersection to find all likely positions in the original, where the search string might be located in the text. The user can then decrypt only those parts or records to obtain all parts or records where the search strings. Our scheme has no false negatives (all occurrences of the search string will be found). We show that the precision becomes close to 100% for longer strings using a corpus consisting of texts in the English language. We also show that the chunks are somewhat, but not quite similar to random bit streams, and that each individual stream has less information content than a typical English language stream of the same length. © 2016 IEEE."

Lagrange duality is used in order to obtain a new characterisation for uniform exponential stability which is in terms of sets of inequalities involving each of the matrices that represent the modes of the system. These sets of inequalities are shown to generalise the classical linear Lyapunov inequality that characterises, in positive matrices, the property of being Schur. Each solution to these sets of inequalities is shown to provide a representation, in terms of a number of linear functionals, for a common Lyapunov function for the switched positive linear system. A result is further presented which conveys to, a conservative upper bound on the minimum required number of linear functionals (in the above mentioned representation), and also to a method for computing them. Our proof for the aforementioned characterisation is based on another (equivalent) characterisation, in terms of the solvability of a dynamic programming equation associated to the switched positive linear system, which is also reported in the paper. In particular, it is shown that the associated dynamic programming equation has at most one solution. And this solution is shown to be convex, monotonic, positively homogeneous, and it yields a common Lyapunov function for the switched positive linear system. © 2015 Taylor & Francis."

A 0D model was used to estimate vessel wall parameters in a two-parameter elastic model and a four-parameter Kelvin viscoelastic model. This was done using nonlinear optimization minimizing the least squares error between model predictions and measured cross-sectional areas. Subsequently, estimated values for elastic stiffness and unstressed area were related to construct a nonlinear relationship. This relation was used in the network model. A 1D single vessel model of the aorta was then developed and used to estimate the inflow profile and parameters for total resistance and compliance for the downstream network and to demonstrate effects of incorporating viscoelasticity in the arterial wall. Lastly, the extent to which vessel wall parameters estimated from ex vivo data can be used to realistically simulate pressure and area in a vessel network was evaluated.

All the information is locally stored in a flash memory card and is later sent to a remote server using GPRS. The device is based on a Texas Instruments development board that uses the Stellaris LM4F232H5QD microcontroller. The system can be remotely configured and it is energetically autonomous since its battery is solar-charged. © 2015 IEEE."

For all these applications, a tool able to simulate time series of wind speed and direction is required. In this paper we propose a methodology for the simulation of bivariate non-stationary time series of wind speed and direction. This methodology takes into account the circular nature of the wind direction, as well as the mean annual cycle of both wind speed and direction. For modelling the joint distribution of the two variables, wind speed is modelled conditioned to the wind direction. For modelling short-term self- and cross-dependency among the variables a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model of order p is used, with an innovation process at time t that depends on the value taken by the variables at time t-1, based on the use of a mixture of multivariate normal distributions. The proposed methodology is applied to a case study, simulating several synthetic series, of the same length as the original series. The simulated series satisfactorily captures the characteristics of averaging or common data (i.e. with low or moderate speed) and, under certain independence conditions, the directional extreme value distribution of the wind speed is also properly reproduced. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

Particularly in Uruguay, and in the rest of Ibero-America, an important part of the architectural heritage has been built with ceramic bricks. Due to the porosity and lack of impermeability of this material, and taking into account the numerous defects of the employed constructive techniques, the presence of moisture represents one of the major problems in the structures of ceramic masonry. Moisture affects the performance and durability of materials, and the aesthetics and habitability of buildings directly. The objective of the present work is to present a methodology for the detection and quantification of the moisture content in ceramic masonry structures, based on Non-Destructive Techniques (NDT). The used NDT were the infrared thermography and the ground penetrating radar. The former constitutes an optimal technique for the primary and immediate detection of possible areas with high moisture content. The latter represents a suitable technique for a more precise detection and quantification of the moisture level. In order to draw this conclusion, the dielectric constants of different types of bricks were obtained at different moisture levels. The moisture content of these bricks was measured in laboratory conditions. A good correlation between the two parameters was observed. Furthermore, the influences of the density and the brick type in that correlation were determined. The presented methodology was applied on walls of small dimensions, real-scale walls and heritage structures with very good results. The main advantage of the proposed methodology is the complementarity of the two techniques. This allows a fast and precise assessment of the moisture content with a minimal intervention of the structure. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London."

After a brief overview of each of the three biomes, representative social-ecological systems of pastoralism are identified with the objective to describe their respective pasture management history, especially the colonization process and the settlement of the pioneers, and the successive farming systems, mainly the practices related to herd and pasture management, are compared. Finally, the main local and national policies regarding the livestock sector and landownership are analyzed. The evolution of the social-ecological systems of pastoralism in these ecoregions was assessed with a three-dimensional model of vulnerability based on the agroecosystem resilience, livelihood improvement, and institutional capability. The evolution of the mental models about livestock has also been analyzed to better understand the current perceptions of the local people and their scenarios for the future of livestock in their social-ecological systems. The results focused on the dynamics of rangeland management, the vulnerability of the pastoral social-ecological systems, and the evolution of the mental models of local people about livestock, so as to discuss the different rhythms of transformation and the existence of critical thresholds. Besides diverse land and social issues, it is imperative to intensify livestock production and increase the offer of new technologies, as well as to identify some relevant human dimension factors, such as the demand of local societies for collective livelihood improvement, the recent national and international environmental policies related to global warming and biodiversity, and the stronger awareness of consumers for sustainable development. In the context of global change, the practices of rangeland management will change in a more sustainable way, resulting in better society-environment interaction and human-nature integration. © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

This work evaluates the properties of CLT panels manufactured in Uruguay with local pine (Pinus taeda and Pinus elliiottii) from forest plantation thinning, which typically present low mechanical properties. Boards and panels were mechanically tested and the mechanical properties were determined, showing a strength class lower than C14. A numerical model, using the finite element method, was developed and the numerical results were compared with the experimental values. The results provided a first approach to the conditions and limitations of the use of CLT panels for building floors, produced under the current manufacturing conditions in Uruguay."

By exploring the notion of image in the work of architect and historian Robin Evans, the nature of this animation is elucidated. The paper discusses Evans’s infatuation with the “powers of the image” from a threefold perspective: what is a theory-image; how is it constructed in and through Evans’s writings; and why is it relevant for the discipline of architecture. Evans’s project is therefore the recovery of the image and its space of projection as a site of theoretical inquiry, one that is crucially distinct from language. Through the analysis of Evans’s work, I would argue, it is possible to sustain a radical conceptualization of theory not merely as specular history – a Doppelgänger of sorts – but as a productive field of inquiry fundamentally decoupled from, yet forever linked to, history. It is necessary in this radical conceptualization to embrace the conjecture of productive theory in lieu of the disciplinarity of history. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Yet, it is also very difficult to obtain because of the interaction of many critical factors that affect employee participation. Therefore, finding ways of measuring all these critical factors can help practitioners manage the employee participation process accordingly. Design/methodology/approach: Based upon the existing literature, this paper presents a 4-Phase (9 steps) diagnostic tool to measure the main determinants associated with the implementation of CI systems affecting employee participation in improvement activities. Findings: The tool showed its usefulness to detect the main weaknesses and improvement opportunities for improving employee participation in CI through the application in two different cases. Practical implications: This diagnostic tool could be particularly interesting for companies adopting CI and other excellence frameworks, which usually include a pillar related to people development inside the organization, but do not include tools to diagnose the state of this pillar. Originality/value: This diagnostic tool presents a user’s perspective approach, ensuring that the weaknesses and improvement opportunities detected during the diagnose come directly from the users of the CI system, which in this case are the employees themselves. Given that the final objective is to identify reasons and problems hindering employee participation, adopting this user’s perspective approach seem more relevant than adopting other more traditional approaches, based on gathering information from the CI system itself or from the CI managers. © 2016, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

In this regard, optical imaging acquisition combined with post-capture processing algorithms enable the synthesis of images with novel viewpoints of a scene. This work presents a new method to reconstruct a pair of stereoscopic images of a 3D-scene from a multi-focus image stack. A conventional monocular camera combined with an electrically tunable lens (ETL) is used for image acquisition. The captured visual information is reorganized considering a piecewise-planar image formation model with a depth-variant point spread function (PSF) along with the known focusing distances at which the images of the stack were acquired. The consideration of a depth-variant PSF allows the application of the method to strongly defocused multi-focus image stacks. Finally, post-capture perspective shifts, presenting each eye the corresponding viewpoint according to the disparity, are generated by simulating the displacement of a synthetic pinhole camera. The procedure is performed without estimation of the depth-map or segmentation of the in-focus regions. Experimental results for both real and synthetic data images are provided and presented as anaglyphs, but it could easily be implemented in 3D displays based in parallax barrier or polarized light. © 2016 SPIE."

The control strategy uses a combined distance-based attractive-repulsive potentials to ensure convergence to the formation pattern avoiding possible inter-robot collisions. In order to avoid unwanted formation patterns that verify the distance constraints, each robot control law includes a volume condition which provides information about the unique desired position of each robot in the formation pattern.

The dc input amplitude that can be blocked is related to the maximum output current that one of the transconductors can provide, hence impacting on the required consumption through this effect. Then, a technique that efficiently blocks the dc input signal and fixes the high-pass frequency is introduced and analyzed in depth. Moreover, an architecture for ultra-low-power differential-input biquads is fully presented. The proposed architecture enables lowering the power consumption or blocking higher levels of dc input without jeopardizing the power consumption. Results show that the proposed architecture, compared with a traditional one, presents a 30% reduction in power consumption and more than doubles the dc input that can be blocked.

Traditional treatments for tartaric stabilization, such as refrigeration, can have a negative effect on the attributes of red wines. This study evaluated the effect of different options of tartaric stabilization on the colour and polyphenolic composition of red wines of V. vinifera L. cv. Tannat. The effect of cold treatment (C), carboxylmethylcellulose (CMC), arabic gum (AG), and carboxylmethylcellulose + arabic gum (CMC+AG) were tested. Basic composition, polyphenolic indexes, colour, and anthocyanin composition were analyzed. The immediate impact of the cold treatment was significant, but differences with the other wines were attenuated over time. The C wines had lower colour intensity, were much brighter and had less redness than the others wines 15 days after the start of the essay. These wines had the lowest anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin contents, while their anthocyanin profile showed a decrease in the proportion of delphinidin, petunidin, and peonidin derivatives, and an increase in the proportion of malvidin derivatives. In addition, they had an increase in the proportion of non-acylated glucosides, and a reduction in the proportion of coumaroyl-glucosides respect to the control. Anyway, the typical anthocyanin profile of the variety was slightly modified in every case. All wines showed low differences in colour and polyphenolic composition at five months fromstabilization. However, the contents of free anthocyanins were diminished by all stabilization treatments in relation to the control wines. At this time, the highest colour intensity was obtained in CMC+GA wines. CMC wines had the highest catechin contents while CMC+GA wines had the highest proanthocyanidin levels. At 14 months, CMC+GA wines had the highest colour intensity, and the lowest luminosity (L*). Colour intensities of C and CMC wines had not differences respect to those of control wines. However, all wines showed precipitation of tartaric salts at 5 and at 14 months from stabilization. Therefore, the tested options do not stabilize the red wines at this time. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

The main purpose of this comparison was not only to evaluate the degree of equivalence in the calibration of high accuracy hydrometers between NMI participants, but also to link, were it is possible, the results of previous Comparisons to Key Comparison Reference Values (KCRVs) of CCM.D-K4. Eleven NMI laboratories took part in the CCM.D-K4 divided in two groups (petals). With the CCM.D-K4 purpose, two similar sets consisting of three hydrometers for liquid density determinations and an alcoholometer were circulated to the NMI participants as a travelling standard in the time interval from January 2011 to April 2012. Twelve Key Comparison Reference Values (KCRVs) for each petal have been obtained at the density values related to the tested density marks of the transfer standards by the results of participants. The KCRVs and corresponding uncertainties were calculated by the weighted mean in the case of consistent results, otherwise the median was used. The degree of equivalence (DoE) with respect to the corresponding KCRV was determined for each participant and, in this particular comparison, the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) method was used to link the individual DoE of each participant by a continuous function. Significant drift of the transfer standards was not detected. This report also gives instructions on calculating pair-wise degrees of equivalence, with the addition of any information on correlations that may be necessary to estimate more accurately as well as the procedure for linking international comparisons to the CCM.D-K4. Finally an example of linkage to the CCM.D-K4 is given by dealing with the results of the bilateral comparison between INRiM and NMIA, which was added to this comparison so that all participants were engaged after the breakage of the 9340171 artefact. A particularly good agreement was found among the results provided by most of the participants, even if some systematic differences and either underestimated or overestimated uncertainties of the submitted results can be identified with respect to the KCRVs. In general the deviations of the laboratory results to the KCRVs are within of 1/3rd to 1/4th of a scale division and the uncertainty at 95 % is usually within half a division. During the analysis of the submitted results, a systematic difference between the first and last immersed mark was also noted, possibly due to a temperature gradient along the stem and/or wetting of the stem around the tested mark, and therefore a corrected claimed uncertainty from each laboratory is expected. However this comparison may help the laboratories to solve some residual or marginal problems as well as to better understand the uncertainty components. The comparison fully supports the calibration measurement capabilities table in the BIPM key comparison database (KCDB). The results can be used to link regional comparisons to this CCM key comparison."

Drying curves of individual kernels were obtained using a thermogravimetric analyzer for three long-grain cultivars (Wells, CL XL745, and CL 142) and two medium-grain cultivars (CL 261 and Jupiter) at 40°C, 50°C, and 60°C. Drying rates of individual kernels were obtained from drying curves using a three-parameter, exponential decay model. Prior to drying experiments, kernel thickness, width and length of individual rough rice kernels were measured using a digital micrometer. Total lipid content, amylose content, protein content and initial moisture content were determined for each cultivar. In general, drying rate increased as kernel thickness decreased for both long-grain and medium-grain cultivars; this effect was more pronounced at 60°C. Kernel width was also a factor that affected drying rates; as kernel width increased, drying rate increased. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers."

Traditional and scientific knowledge constitute the basis of the various uses of plants from in situ harvesting to complete domestication of crops. One of the most important challenges of our time is to achieve the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources of landraces, species in the process of domestication and species used in situ. The in situ conservation of agricultural biodiversity is a basic element for the development of more sustainable agroecosystems, the adaptation to climate change, the conservation of ecosystem services and to ensure local food security-a conception that is strongly linked to the local development and the protection of cultural and biological diversity. Through case studies from the Pampa Biome we will discuss the valorization of plant genetic resources through new domestication, the promotion of the use of scientifically developed best management practices for in situ conservation, the widening of the germplasm base for breeding programs, plant breeding for stress tolerance, the development of participatory plant breeding programs and the development of high quality products. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015."

The most important outcome is the derivation of explicit relationships between the structure of the grid, the optimal transmission and distribution of energy, and the grid's collective behavior (namely, the synchronous generation of power). These relationships are extremely relevant for the design of resilient power-grid models. To allow the reader to apply these results to other complex systems, the thesis includes a review of relevant aspects of network theory, spectral theory, and novel analytical calculations to predict the existence and stability of periodic collective behavior in complex networks of phase oscillators, which constitute a paradigmatic model for many complex systems. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

Dynamic vibration tests were performed on eight 40 × 100 × 2500 mm3 chestnut timber beams and signal processing was applied to obtain the natural frequencies and the damping ratio. Each beam was considered in three support systems: one simulating the free-free condition, and the other two were obtained by supporting them on different steel fasteners.

The SIESTA approach was used to obtain the equilibrium positions of all atoms and the Full-Potential Augmented Plane Wave plus local orbital (FP-APW+lo) method was employed in order to obtain the electronic structure at these equilibrium positions and all the other physical properties. For the most stable (001) α-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> surface, we have demonstrated that the inclusion of the Cd atom at substitutional Al sites at and near the surface produces a ground state magnetic behavior. The largest principal component V<inf>33</inf> of the electric-field-gradient (EFG) tensor at the Cd atom localized just above the α-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> terrace showed the same [001] orientation and a dominating p-character as Cd does when it is localized at bulk α-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, but exhibits an anomalous V<inf>33</inf> magnitude four times larger than its value in bulk. Just below the surface, the non symmetric structural relaxation around the Cd impurity is responsible for the strong change in the asymmetry, magnitude, and orientation of the EFG tensor. The changes in the hyperfine properties have been correlated with the modifications observed on the electronic charge density at the different Cd sites and on the p-states of the Cd-projected partial density of states. Accordingly, the significant differences on the hyperfine parameters showed for different depths suggest that 111Cd probe-atoms used in Perturbed γ-γ Angular Correlation experiments could be used for evaluating geometrical and electronic distortions, particularly for positions quite close to the reconstructed surface, as well as contributing to studies of growth, adsorption, and diffusion of atoms in oxide surfaces and interfaces. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."

The search was carried out by means of the Scopus and Google Scholar internet search engines without publishing date restrictions, and produced 84 references comprising book chapters and journal articles. Detection techniques and sample preparation are discussed in detail. As expected, the majority of the articles refer to the use of atomic spectrometric techniques such as atomic absorption and emission and plasma source mass spectrometry. Sample preparation techniques range from simple dilution in organic solvent to various wet-ashing approaches including microwave-assisted digestion and formation of emulsions and microemulsions, either batch-wise or by means of flow injection analysis. Dry ashing is also reported. Based on this review, it can be concluded that the determination of the mineral contents of edible oils and fats may be relevant from the technological and toxicological points of view but not from the nutritional one.

Some micronutrients are in general more abundant in aquatic animals and plants than mammalian meats or terrestrial vegetables. Since ancient times, fish and shellfish have been used as food, but only in the second period of the twentieth century has aquatic food gained enormous relevance. Chemical composition of fish varies greatly among species and from an individual fish to another, depending on age, sex, environment, and season. Fish is the only protein source that contains all the essential amino acids. Lipids and proteins are the major components of fish food; meanwhile carbohydrates are usually detected at very low levels (&lt;0.5 %). Fish is an excellent source of valuable micronutrients, vitamins, and minerals; vitamin content in fish is compared to that in mammals with the exception of vitamins A, D, and B12. Fish enzymes obtained from fish offal and discards from the fishery industry are relevant owing to their applications to other food industries besides fisheries. Finally, a huge number of nutraceuticals from fish are being researched with enormous great application to human health.

Robust approaches have been proposed to deal with noisy nonintegrable gradient fields. In this work we extend some of these techniques for the case of dynamic scenes when the gradient field in the x-y domain can be estimated over time.

Some of these problems are due to a vertical and functional vision of the organization, without any global BP vision. In this context, similar decentralized organizational units very often perform the same BPs sometimes in different ways. Moreover, some BPs are implicit in the IS supporting them. In this article we present an experience report of a BPM pilot project we have carried out within our university, as an initiative to improve BPs management and corresponding IS support. We started specifying a process map for management support BPs, and then we selected key BPs which where specified, modeled and implemented using BPMN 2.0 and Bonita BPMS, to shift the organization focus from traditional IS to Process Aware IS (PAIS). © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015"

This paper is concerned with an instrument that uses tuning fork technology to estimate mud density in the field. A model explaining how the tuning fork operates and how it can be used to measure mud properties is presented. In this model, the tuning fork is represented as a damped harmonic oscillator, and the mud is considered a viscoelastic medium showing an elastic response for small deformations and a viscous response for large deformations. The model clearly shows that the tuning fork must be calibrated for the local mud at each survey location. This was confirmed during surveys at the Amazon estuary and the Río de la Plata during 2011 and 2012.

Estimated average economic losses are annually 500 million USD in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Designing efficient pest control management using selective and targeted pesticide applications is extremely important both from economic and environmental perspectives. With that in mind, we conducted a research program during the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 planting seasons in a 4,000 ha soybean farm, seeking to achieve early pest detection. Nowadays pest presence is evaluated using manual, labor-intensive counting methods based on sampling strategies which are time consuming and imprecise. The experiment was conducted as follows. Using manual counting methods as ground-Truth, a spectrometer capturing reflectance from 400 to 1100 nm was used to measure the reflectance of soy plants. A first conclusion, resulting from measuring the spectral response at leaves level, showed that stress was a property of plants since different leaves with different levels of damage yielded the same spectral response. Then, to assess the applicability of unsupervised classification of plants as healthy, biotic-stressed or abiotic-stressed, feature extraction and selection from leaves spectral signatures, combined with a Supported Vector Machine classifier was designed. Optimization of SVM parameters using grid search with cross-validation, along with classification evaluation by ten-folds cross-validation showed a correct classification rate of 95%, consistently on both seasons. Controlled experiments using cages with different numbers of caterpillars-including caterpillar-free plants-were also conducted to evaluate consistency in trends of the spectral response as well as the extracted features. © 2015 SPIE."

The cyclic variability is a well-known phenomenon in this kind of engines, especially when operating at lean conditions. It can affect engine stability and efficiency to a great extent. Among its main causes is the development of turbulent combustion in each cycle, which is associated with turbulent flow during admission. On the other hand, hydrogen is a fuel known by its elevated laminar flame speed which is, in principle, interesting to increase the rate of combustion, and so decrease cyclic variability effects. Our group has developed a quasi-dimensional numerical simulation that incorporates cycle- To-cycle variability. In the present work the effect of hydrogen addition is considered in the model. Wrinkled flame effects are taken into account by introducing a linear factor that depends on the amount of hydrogen in the fuel, affecting the flame area development. The model is validated by direct comparison with experimental results. Studying the coefficient of variation of power output time series, it is concluded that for lean mixtures, when the percentage of hydrogen increases, the cyclic variability decreases up to a minimum value which depends on the fuel- Air equivalence ratio. Minimum values of cyclic variability amplitude are observed at fuel ratios near 0.9 and 70% percentage of hydrogen in fuel by volume."

This enzyme converts halophenols found in the environment where the worm lives, into quinones by dehalogenation. The enzyme has globin structure and function, but works also as a peroxidase in the presence of H2O2 which binds to the iron present in the heme group. The initial step in the enzymatic reaction path is the transformation of the heme Fe(III) ion into a ferryl (Fe = O) moiety. A distal histidine, His55, is crucial for this process. His55 can occupy two positions, either in the distal pocket of the active center (<“closed”), or exposed to the solvent (“open”). NMR experiments show that His55 moves between those positions in the resting state of the enzyme. For this process to occur it is necessary that a gate, composed of a triad Asn37-Lys36-Lys51 and two carboxylates on the heme group, suffer a conformational change before and after the passage of the histidine. We examined computationally this process at the B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level, within a PCM simulated aqueous environment. This analysis leads us to propose a correction of the experimental structure of the enzyme determined by X-ray crystallography and offers an explanation for different conformations of the twin carboxylates at the heme group observed in the crystals. This new proposal agrees with the experimentally determined electron density distributions and explains the role of the His55 as a functional hook for the peroxide in the aqueous media. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015."

In all but one simulators reviewed the ventilator under test (VUT) provides energy: simulation is limited to passive resistance/compliance with no sham spontaneous breathing to trigger the mechanical ventilator (MV). Objective: We improved our SIMVENT, a simulator to materialize lung equations with user selected ventilatory mechanics parameters, capable of producing spontaneous breathing to test MV operation. SIMVENT evaluates ventilators as VUTs. We designed an assisted ventilation training software to operate SIMVENT. Method: SIMVENT includes a cylinder with a step-motor powered piston, a cylinder mimicking residual volume, sensors for “alveolar” & “airway” pressures, a step-motor compressed tubing to simulate variable airway resistance, a microcontroller and a computer interface. SIMVENT acts as a patient with programmed values of airway resistance and lung compliance. SIMVENT compares flow and pressure signals with those shown by the VUT. Spontaneous inspiration attempts are created by SIMVENT to test VUT: breathing pressure drops are selected (5 cmH2O e.g.) either at random or phase-locked to the respiratory cycle. A report is generated for each VUT. SIMVENT was designed with ""User centered"" methodology. Results: Four ventilators were tested. VUT tidal volume differed up to 15%, airway pressure was within 8% and respiratory frequency within 4% of SIMVENT values. Conclusions: SIMVENT proved to be useful to test and compare ventilators as to their ability to detect spontaneous breathing. For the first time ventilators can be fully evaluated prior to clinical use. SIMVENT may also be used to train physicians. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015."

A strong relationship between the compressive strength of brickwork specimens tested and the compressive strength of the bricks they were manufactured with, is observed. The equations that best appear to link these two mechanical characteristics, for bricks with compressive strengths up to 25 daN/cm2, were determined. However, is not observed a direct relation between tested brickwork specimens bending or shear strength, and the compressive strength of the bricks with which they were manufactured.

A robot patient was developed (called SIMVENT) to test MVs after repair or to compare MVs in hospitals. SIMVENT is a complete active patient simulator, as opposed to rubber bag simulation. SIMVENT implements lung equations under given user selected parameters of ventilatory mechanics to simulate different respiratory conditions. By producing spontaneous breathing (SB) pressure drops (1-10 cm H2O) at random times or phase-locked to ventilation cycles, SIMVENT tests the capacity of MVs to sense spontaneous ventilation. SIMVENT also calculates basic mechanical parameters (frequency, airway pressure, esophageal pressure, resistance and compliance). SIMVENT was designed with a step-motor powered piston moving in a 2-litre cylinder, a second cylinder mimicking residual volume, pressure sensors, a variable resistance tube, a microcontroller and a computer interface. A normalized spontaneous breathing detection graph was constructed for two MVs: one behaved well and the other could be harmful if ventilating a patient during weaning, because SBs were not sensed at the set pressure-drop value. © 2015 IEEE."

Efficient bioelectrocatalysis relies on controllable methods to immobilize biomolecules in a manner that optimizes orientation and interaction between protein and a transducer. Enzymes typically exhibit poor stability over continuous use. This chapter discusses numerous approaches to immobilizing enzymes for bioelectrocatalysis with the goal of providing guidance toward rational design. It begins with a discussion on immobilization by physical methods, and on entrapment of enzymes. Next, the chapter talks about enzyme immobilization via chemical methods.

This work develops a methodology to estimate the economic value of water in a basin with large hydropower production and a growing demand for rice irrigation, based on a coupled hydrological and electric system modelling approach. Inflow deficits to the hydroelectric system induced by the irrigation reservoirs within the basin are simulated under different irrigation scenarios. The simulated inflow deficits are integrated to an existing model of the interconnected electric system to evaluate the associated increase in generation costs under different energy scenarios. The impact of inflow deficits in turbinated and spilled flow and generation costs are comprehensively explored. Both annual mean and interannual variability of overcosts increase with increasing irrigation demand. However, if normalized by yearly varying rice planted area, the distribution of additional costs does not change substantially. Moreover, the distribution of normalized overcosts per unit irrigated area is also invariant to energy scenarios, although the relative impact in total costs decreases as the proportion of hydroelectric generation diminishes. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

In order to improve the ability of these models, in the twentieth century it was introduced the spring-pot element. The models that include a spring-pot are called Fractional Viscoelastic Models (FVMs) and have provided promising results for modeling materials such as polymers and living tissue. Our aim is to improve the accuracy of these models through the use of a modified version of the spring-pot, called high-order spring-pot (HOSP). In this article we implement a numerical method for characterization of mechanical properties of FVMs from stress strain measures. We validate the implementation using artificially generated data with and without noise added. Afterwards, we apply the method to ovine arterial wall data presented in the literature. The method is applied using the spring-pot and the HOSP. The results obtained using the artificial data, show that the method is able to characterize the mechanical parameters even in presence of low-level noise. For the experimental data the results show a notable improvement using the HOSP. We conclude that the FMVs are improved when a high-order spring-pot is included. In particular, it was shown that these models are appropriate for modeling arterial wall behavior, which represent better results in computational simulations of the arterial wall mechanics."

The precomputed data stored in memory can be protected then by applying traditional and well established ECC algorithms to provide fault tolerant hardware designs. At the same time, the transformation increases the performance of the system by reducing its execution time, which is then used by customized software-based fault tolerant techniques to protect the system without any degradation when compared to its original form. Application of this technique to key algorithms in a MP3 player, combined with a fault injection campaign, show that this approach increases fault tolerance up to 92%, without any performance degradation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) solver caffa3d.MB was employed to simulate the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The numerical method uses a spatial discretization based on block-structured, nonorthogonal body fitted grids. Numerical simulations for two different PCB geometry configurations are analysed using eight Reynolds numbers. The temperature field is practically the same above the plate encasing the PCB, differences appear below the plate. While analysing the plane just below for the open geometry the main consideration is the presence of a hot zone. The greater heat transfer is obtained in the top channel for both geometries. In turn, in the bottom channel the heat transfer is greater in the closed geometry than the open one. The calculating results show that the cooling of the PCB is more efficient for the closed geometry. © 2014 WIT Press."

The assessment of psychopathology in childhood is commonly carried out by performing long comprehensive interviews such as the widely used Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA). Unfortunately, the time required to complete a full interview is too long to apply it at the scale of the actual population at risk, and most of the population goes undiagnosed or is diagnosed significantly later than desired. In this work, we aim to learn from unique and very rich previously collected PAPA examples the inter-correlations between different questions in order to provide a reliable risk analysis in the form of a much shorter interview. This helps to put such important risk analysis at the hands of regular practitioners, including teachers and family doctors. We use for this purpose the alternating decision trees algorithm, which combines decision trees with boosting to produce small and interpretable decision rules. Rather than a binary prediction, the algorithm provides a measure of confidence in the classification outcome. This is highly desirable from a clinical perspective, where it is preferable to abstain a decision on the low-confidence cases and recommend further screening. In order to prevent over-fitting, we propose to use network inference analysis to predefine a set of candidate question with consistent high correlation with the diagnosis. We report encouraging results with high levels of prediction using two independently collected datasets. The length and accuracy of the developed method suggests that it could be a valuable tool for preliminary evaluation in everyday care. © 2014 IEEE."

The SiNWs were synthesized by self-assembly electroless metal deposition nanoelectrochemistry in an ionic silver HF solution through selective etching. Total reflectance (Rt) and total diffuse reflectance (Rdt) of SiNWs change drastically in comparison to polished Si. To understand these changes diffuse reflectance (Rd) with polarized incident light was studied. For samples prepared on Si(111), the wavelength integrated Rd (wIRd) shows maxima at certain angle of incidence θ and it does not depend on light polarization. Moreover, Rdt of SiNWs prepared on Si(111) can be modeled as an ensemble of diffuse reflectors. For samples prepared on Si(100) wIRd increases with θ, being greater when the light electric field is parallel to the plane of incidence. Also, Rd spectra show structures due to interference effects. For these reasons SiNWs prepared on Si(100) can be considered as a thin film whose refractive index depends on light polarization. © 2014 Materials Research Society."

Today's cryptography still requires encrypted data to be decrypted before it can be searched. We propose here an alternative way of protecting the privacy of data through dispersion of a compressed version of the original data that can be searched without recovering the original data. Our scheme compresses the original data and then generates several chunks that are stored at different nodes. The chunks are stored in the form of an index. To search for a string, we convert the string into chunks with the same scheme and then have each site consult its index in order to obtain a list of all possible positions where the search string might be found. These local results are then sent to the user who performs a logical intersection to find all likely positions in the original, where the search string might be located in the text. The user can then decrypt only those parts or records to obtain all parts or records where the search string is. Our scheme has no false negatives (all occurrences of the search string will be found). We show that the precision becomes close to 100% for longer strings using a corpus consisting of texts in the English language. We also show that the chunks are somewhat, but not quite similar to random bit streams, and that each individual stream has less information content than a typical English language stream of the same length. © 2014 IEEE."

Therefore, in first instance extreme site conditions were required both in front of and behind the breakwater. To obtain these conditions, the first step is to extrapolate the offshore variables in order to translate them to the breakwater location. All the possible combinations of extreme wind, water level and waves are quantified with a probability of occurrence. A combination of univariate extreme value distributions, copula's and regression is used to describe the multivariate statistical behaviour of the offshore variables. The main variable is the wind velocity, as in the area of concern extreme wave conditions are wind driven. The secondary variable is water level. Wind velocity and water levels are only correlated for some wind directions. For these directions, wind velocity and water level extreme value distributions are linked through a multivariate Gumbel Copula. The wave height at the model boundaries was taken into account by a regression function with the extreme wind velocity at the offshore location and the wave period by a regression function with the wave height. This way 1515 synthetic events were selected and simulated with the spectral wave model SWAN, each of which a frequency of occurrence is calculated for. However, due to refraction and diffraction effects of the approach channel (in the area of concern water depths are limited to about 7 m and the navigation channel has a depth of about 14 m), the port basin and the breakwater itself, the spectral wave model SWAN is not sufficient to accurately calculate the local wave conditions in the entire area of interest. Therefore a non-linear Boussinesq wave model (i.e. Mike 21 BW) was set up in addition, using input from the spectral model at the boundary and including the navigation channel of more than 12 km long. Combining both models, significant wave heights are obtained on both the seaward side and the leeside of the breakwater with corresponding frequencies of occurrence. This approach allows the determination of conditional return periods and generates the site conditions required for a probabilistic level three design of the breakwater and the jetty infrastructure taking for example the joint probabilities between waves and water levels fully into account as needed for overtopping or failure calculations.

Remarkable benefits are available when managing production planning and optimisation with a modern IT system supporting global optimisation-based scheduling. The implementation effort for such systems is now quite modest. Even in a modern integrated pulp and papermill employing high quality automation systems, the production schedule is typically crafted in a manual or semi-manual fashion, unsupported by a global constraint model that considers all of the day-today operating issues. Customers' orders are aggregated into paper type families and typically the top-level addresses the block schedule at the paper machine. Taking this as an input, the planner tries to schedule the pulp production resources (mainly the digesters). In order to find a feasible solution, various iterations between the two levels are conducted based on different feedback mechanisms. In this process, feasibility is placed over optimality, leading to suboptimal production plans and schedules. Nevertheless significant improvement is possible when combining optimalplans with feasible execution within day-to-day operation. Lasslett has earlier observed that production at different bottlenecks in a mill would need to be maximised, but not at any cost. He suggests that the rest of the mill must also be coordinated with precise planning to ensure that not only the maximum production takes place at the bottlenecks, but also costs are minimised and the whole mill should be best prepared to deal with unplanned events at any time. Given the situation with existing methods of manual planning and scheduling, various studies suggest there is non-trivial potential for improvement simply by the introduction of a tool for optimisation based scheduling. Mills, where production constraints are dynamic and pulp production is directly linked with the block schedule of paper machines, are the ones which have the most potential for improvement. However, other pulp producers can also benefit. The concept, although not new, has been difficult to introduce in the past. This problem has been recently solved in a practical manner. It is now possible for the scheduling system to calculate the production schedules for modelled pulp mill processes and storage tanks dynamically. The paper and presentation will discuss this in detail. Although the amount of data required from various information points remains high, with OPC and other modern integration technologies, existing process data collection technology is up to the task. The upfront investment required to make the scheduling system work for an integrated mill is small compared to the benefits, and thus the return on investment (ROI) can be in months, sometimes even weeks."

We derived a simple analytical solution that lends itself to a systematic study of design parameters and verified the solution with a numeric solution of the Maxwell equations using finite elements.

Also the need of measurements with different logistic requirements (e.g. from different platforms as from mobile, airborne, vessels, etc) it is of benefit to develop a new optical system for data acquisition. There are two key aspects to take into account: One of them is the importance to preserve a constant temperature on the spectrometer's CCD. The second key aspect is to have a standalone unit which can be attached to different telescopes or to other optical devices in order to confront different experimental situations, and to be able to measure different optical parameters without the hassle of being concerned about the reliability of the spectrometer's condition.

It presents and analyzes the nature of the housing sector, which is defined as systemic due to its impact (in conjunction with the social issue) on the general development of the production and financial systems of a country and its systemic efficiency in relation to the external situation. This paper scrutinizes the different stages involved in the evolution of the systemic integration of housing, which includes the transformation of its social function into a financial and productive function. These policy categories evolved as follows: from the classical (universal) social policies on housing and (targeted) social housing policies defining the role of the State in the production of dwellings, to the recent inclusion of the low-cost housing concept that replicates the experience of other Latin American countries and creates a quasi-housing market that ignores the social issue."

It will be shown that the main effects that determine the degradation or improvement of mode damping due to wind power generation lies in the alteration of the operating points of the involved synchronous generators and the nature of the oscillatory modes affected. It is also analyzed the effect of reactive power exchange between wind farms and the power grid on oscillatory behaviour. Such developments are validated by performing simulations on a 2017 peak scenario for the Uruguayan transmission system, which shows a strong interaction between the pre-existent hydro power plants and future wind farms to be incorporated1. © 2013 IEEE."

The precomputed data stored in memory can be protected then by applying traditional and well established ECC algorithms to provide fault tolerant hardware designs. At the same time, the transformation increases the performance of the system by reducing its execution time, which is then used by customized software-only fault tolerant techniques to protect the system without any degradation when compared to its original form.

Wind flows at mean velocities between 1. m/s and 3. m/s were simulated, as well as with different energy content at turbulence small-scale. The wind modeling methodologies applied to do so are presented. At a mean velocity, if the turbulence small-scales' energy is high, the consequent leaves' displacement is greater than when the former is low, decreasing the contact time between the leaf and the fruit. Nevertheless, the rest of the tree components do not present significant differences in their responses. This led us to infer that the greater energy at turbulence small-scales could be correlated with a lower period of time a leaf rubs against an adjacent fruit. Therefore, leaves' mechanical action and the consequent damage could be reduced increasing the turbulence small-scale energy content. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

Objective: The aim of this work was to assess time invariance of the AWMP in short time. Methods: using a previously developed mock circulation system, dynamic pressure-diameter tests were performed on segments of human fresh (n=10) and cryo-preserved arteries (n=7), constituting the in-vitro analysis. 20 healthy and 12 essential hypertensive men were enrolled for the in-vivo studio. An autoregressive with hexogen input adaptive digital system (ARXS) was implemented. Input and output of the ARXS in the in-vitro study were pressure (micro transducer, 1200 Hz frequency response, Königsberg Instruments Inc., Pasadena, CA, USA) and diameter (piezoelectric crystals and sonomicrometer, 1000 Hz frequency response, Triton Technology Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) respectively and in the in-vivo study pressure (pulse tonometer, Millar Instruments Inc., Houston, TX, USA) and diameter (real time B-mode ultrasound imager, ATL HDI 5000, Miami Lakes, Florida, USA) respectively. Diameter/Pressure transfer function was implemented in order to evaluate the mechanical wall properties. Short time invariance of AWMP was assessed using variation coefficients (VC). Results: both analysis (in-vivo and in- vitro) showed temporal invariance in all the wall mechanical indexes evaluated (VC <10%) when were evaluated by means of a beat to beat analysis (20 to 40 beats) respect to the single beat interpolated analysis. Conclusions: Short time invariance of the arterial wall mechanical properties could minimize the determination of mechanical wall indexes (in stable situations), using the single beat interpolation approach, reducing processing time and data analysis. © 2013 Springer-Verlag."

This conception differs significantly from the current view, in which the cellular compartment is regarded as a highly crowded media of marked structural heterogeneity. Can the finding of relatively simple dynamic properties of transport processes in epithelia be compatible with this complex structural conception of the cell interior? The purpose of this work is to contribute with one simple theoretical approach to answer this question. For this, the techniques of model reduction are utilized to obtain a two-state reduced model from more complex linear models of transcellular transport with a larger number of intermediate states. In these complex models, each state corresponds to the solute concentration in an intermediate intracellular compartment. In addition, the numerical studies reveal that it is possible to approximate a general two-state model under conditions where strict reduction of the complex models cannot be performed. These results contribute with arguments to reconcile the current conception of the cell interior as a highly complex medium with the finding of relatively simple dynamic properties of transport across epithelial cells. © 2013 Julio A.

In all cases, as-grown films were amorphous and photoelectrochemically inactive. An annealing procedure is necessary to completely transform the electrodeposited iron oxide to α-Fe 2O3 phase. XRD analyses confirm the presence of diffraction peaks corresponding to hematite after annealing, showing a strong preferential orientation of the [110] axis vertical to the substrate. Different techniques (XRD techniques, XPS analyses, SEM images, UV-Vis spectroscopy, Mott-Schottky plots and photocurrent-potential curves) have been employed in order to characterize the films and determinate their properties according with the conditions of electrodeposition and the annealing temperature. © The Electrochemical Society."

Consequently, developers can use this technique to enrich their programming language with new syntax specifically tailored to the problem domain in which they are working. However, the creation of an extensible programming language poses a series of implementation challenges and requires the use of specialized parsing algorithms. Although much discussion has taken place, there exists little information on precisely how extensible programming can be implemented, especially using LR parsing. This chapter presents a complete and operational set of implementation steps and the precise alterations to the LR parsing algorithm that are needed in order to create an extensible programming language. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media."

Each one of these formats is handled according to their independent algorithms. Consequently, any type of hydraulic study performed in a territory contains information that can be classified by these two formats. LiDAR is the most precise technology used to generate Digital Elevation Models (DEM) for large areas, with a spatial resolution of 1 to 2 m and a minimum precision in height. It gives the cartographic information its raster characteristic, with the cell as its basic unit of information. Consequently, this kind of information is very suitable to the generation of structured quadrilateral meshes to numerically model free surface flow in two dimensions. The main objective of this work was to present an adaptation of the classic explicit first order finite volumes scheme to a finite square volumes (FSV) mesh which, directly and without interpolations, makes each cell in the DEM (or raster) equal to the corresponding FSV. Consequently, the dimensions of the FSV are those of the base DEM cell. This is presented herein as a raster approach to the hydrodynamic problem of free surface flow in two dimensions. With the raster approach, the database for the mesh topology does not need to be consulted for each instant of time and, therefore, the efficiency of the numeric process is greatly improved. Consequently, larger-sized problems can be addressed. An additional objective was to compare both approaches by solving an illustrative example."

In 2012, this week was devoted to energy and sustainability. In this framework we carried out an interactive activity in five primary school classes with the aim of bringing materials science and solar energy to children between 10 and 12 years old. In the beginning of the activity we asked students to complete a brief survey containing a few questions about materials and energy. This survey allowed us to further the children's knowledge about these topics. Then, we introduced materials science history relating it with mankind development. From the active participation of children in the activity, we derived to materials applied in solar cells, performing demonstrations with real solar cells and showing their importance for improving our country energetic efficiency while preserving the environment. At the end of each activity students showed great enthusiasm about including alternative energies in their daily life. Furthermore, they realized the importance of materials science, and were capable of understanding the relation between materials and the development of solar cells. We consider the spread of this activity as an excellent way of creating consciousness from an early age, which will help in the achievement of a more sustainable country. © 2013 Materials Research Society."

The authorities of the City of Montevideo decided to replace the 45 years old metallic acoustic shell by a new shell of reinforced brick and requested our office to project a shell of about 600 m 2 , which should cover the stage of the theatre and should fit the existing colourful open tribune. It was designed as a conoidal vault of reinforced brick. In addition to self weight, wind pressure and other stresses, the vault should be able to bear hanging devices for illumination, acoustics, curtains, etc., totaling 72 tons. The ruled surfaced was generated by the movement of a straight line along two catenary arches. A finite element program was used for designing, which dealt with curves with different degrees of approximation to catenaries. A special formwork was projected, consisting of nine rows of steel towers that supported a wood and timber superstructure. Modular steel towers were designed to be reused in following works. The masonry consisted of hollow bricks (25 cm × 25 cm × 17 cm), manufactured in Montevideo. Steel bars were placed in the 2 cm thick joints between bricks and in the external mortar layer. In order to increase steel protection against corrosion, the mortar for the joints and for the external layer was designed with low water/cement ratio. Laying out the curved surface and positioning the joints on the formwork presented considerable difficulties. Organisation of labour force in two shifts with complementary tasks brought economical and time benefits. The project was prepared in 2006. The construction took 4 months, it finished in December 2006. This paper presents the process of design and construction of the shell. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

The edge reliability RG(p) is a polynomial in p with degree m = |E|, and the exact computation of RG(p) is in the class of NP-Hard problems. However, the related literature is vast, and offers bounds and estimation techniques, as well as exponential algorithms to exactly find that polynomial. We propose a novel interpolation-based technique that exploits the structure of the Hilbert space L2[0; 1], and combines the efficiency of Newton interpolation with the simplicity of Monte Carlo reliability estimation in selected abscissas in [0; 1]. The aim is to guide the polynomial search respecting algebraic properties of the target polynomial coefficients. We illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in the lights of a naive graph with limited size, and discuss several hints for future work. © 2013 IEEE."

Charge compensation mechanisms were characterized by room temperature measurements; LSTC has a perovskite pseudocubic structure with an A-site vacancy concentration related with Co doping level. This result seems to be triggered by the fact that Ti remains in a higher formal valence (around 4+) independent of the Co concentrations. On the contrary, Co K-edge XANES spectra show a dependency with the doping level but this seems to be related to structural changes. In-situ measurements simulating a symmetric SOFC working environment show that LSTC undergoes a rhombohedral to cubic perovskite phase transition with critical temperature dependent of the structural distortion level. © The Electrochemical Society."

Non-invasive vascular evaluation has emerged as a useful tool to aid in individual cardiovascular (CV) risk stratification and diagnose. The use of CIMT in CV risk stratification requires knowing the expected reference values for the population studied. Our aim were: a) to evaluate the relationship between aging and CIMT, b) to analyze gender and side (right vs left) related-differences in CIMT and c) to determine the CIMT reference values for an Uruguayan population taking into account aging-related CIMT changes. Methods: 367 asymptomatic subjects without known CV disease or risk factors were included in the study. Subjects were divided into six age groups. High-resolution B-mode ultrasound images of both (right and left) common carotid arteries were obtained based on the techniques and recommendations described in international consensus. Results: No significant age-related differences in CIMT between men and women were observed. The mean left CIMT was thicker compared with right CIMT in groups 4, 5 and 6.

For this purpose, the thermal comfort in public buildings has been studied in order to set a range of comfort temperatures according to the type of building and moderate climate conditions. The article proposes an approach of thermal comfort in public buildings with variable occupation. Four buildings have been studied in two cities: Two with artificially conditioning environments and two under free running conditions, as well as occupants' responses about ambient temperature conditions, preferences and actions to achieve comfort, through surveys. The environmental data is linked with the response of people based on adaptive thermal comfort. Two different range of comfort temperature are settled for each city. The annual ranges proposed for Montevideo (18.8 to 27.2°C) and Salto (19.2 to 28.1°C) have an amplitude of at least 7°C while for ASHRAE the range is 19 to 25°C. The operative temperature presents meaningful correlations with the response of ""neither cold nor hot"" in naturally conditioned buildings so this could be used as an index of thermal satisfaction in this kind of buildings."

Ground based experiments have shown that by stimulating the cardiovascular system via simple mental stressors, syncope can be delayed, potentially enabling astronauts to reach assistance before loss of consciousness. However, the effect of mental stressors on the stimulation of the cardiovascular system is unknown in gravitational environments different than that of Earth's. As such, this paper investigates the effects that mental stressors have under various gravitational environments. To do this, a pilot study was performed in which two participants were own on two separate parabolic flights that simulated hyper and hypogravity conditions. The plane used was an Aerobatic Single-Engine Cap-1 OB plane (twin seater), and each participant executed 11 parabolas. The participants were the winners of the Barcelona Zero-G Challenge 2011 organized by UPC Barcelona Tech and Aeroclub Barcelona-Sabadell. Measurements were made of the participants' hemodynamic and autonomic response throughout the parabolas, using a Chronocord. Comparisons of the baseline response without mental stressors, and the response with mental stressors were made. It was determined that there is an increase in cardiovascular activity during hypo- and hyper-gravity when performing mental arithmetic. ©(2012) by the International Astronautieal Federation."

The proposed methods is based on the polarization properties of liquid-crystal displays (LCD) and on the capacity of digital micro mirror devices to generate a (positive) copy of the digital image used as input, and simultaneously a complementary color replica of it. In the proposed optical setup the negative and positive replicas are at the same time imagined across a plane. First we analyzed the case when the negative replica has a lateral differential displacement relative to the original one; an image with enhanced first derivatives along a specific direction is obtained. In the case when the negative replica is low-pass filtered, one obtains the Laplacian of the original image. Unlike Fourier, our proposal works with incoherent illumination and does not require precise alignment, and thus, it could be a useful tool for edge extraction/enhancement in large images in real-time applications.

The first stage consists of a completely integrated high pass preamplifier, with 25db gain, 4.5μ V rms input referred noise (70-200Hz), and 600nW power consumption. The second stage is a 55-180Hz GmC filter that incorporates the ability to filter input signals with a high common mode input up to 15V. Moreover, a novel full wave precision rectifier and a low power comparator are presented to complete the cardiac sensing channel. © 2012 EDIUNS."

Four past flood events of high return period were used for calibration and validation with accurate results. The input data to the operational model in real time are hourly observed rainfall and gauge height, as well as rainfall forecasts by several international sources. The use of predictions from numerical weather forecasts allows for the generation of pre-alert scenarios with larger lead time.

To do so, all objects in A might have to be slightly moved according to a mathematical transformation. Such transformation might ideally be of a specific type, like analytical or conformal functions. We have developed a theory to find a suitable analytical transformation despite it is not well defined because the only data available is the displacement vectors at a limited number of homologue control points. There exists a similar problem in fluid mechanics devoted on estimating the complete velocity field given just values at a limited number of points. We borrowed some ideas from there and introduced them into the positional accuracy improvement problem. We shall demonstrate that it is possible to numerically estimate an analytic function that resembles the given displacement at control points. As a byproduct, an uncertainty estimation is produced, which might help to detect regions of different lineage. The theory has been applied to rural 1:50.000 cartography of Uruguay while trying to diminish the discrepancies against GNSS readings. After the analytic transformation, the RMSE error diminished from 116 m to 48 m.

On the one hand, there are systems where agents interact with users through dialogues and animations, helping them to find products while learning from their preferences to plan future transactions. On the other hand, there are systems that employ knowledge-bases to determine the context of the interactions and to define the boundaries inherently established by the e-Commerce. This paper introduces the idea of developing an agent with both capabilities: negotiation and interaction in an e-Commerce application via virtual reality (with a view to apply it in the Latin-American market, where both the technological gap and an inappropriate approach to motivate electronic transactions are important factors). We address these issues by presenting a negotiation strategy that allows the interaction between an intelligent agent and a human consumer with Latin-American idiosyncrasy and by including a graphical agent to assist the user on a virtual basis.

In accordance with this, aging associates structural and functional changes evidenced in variations in vascular parameters witch suffer alterations during atherosclerosis and have been proposed as early markers of the disease. The absence of adequate tools to differentiate the expected (normal) vascular changes due to aging from those related with a vascular disease is not a minor issue. For an individual, an early diagnosis of a vascular disease should be as important as the diagnosis of a healthy vascular aging. Recent studies have proposed that the capacitive or reservoir function of the aorta and large elastic arteries plays a major role in determining the pulse wave morphology. The arterial pressure waveform can be explained in terms of a reservoir pressure, related to the arterial system compliance, and an excess or wave-related pressure, associated with the traveling waves. The aim of this study was to evaluate, by means of a mathematical approach, age-related changes in measured, reservoir and excess central aortic pressure in order to determine if age-related changes are concentrated in particular decades of life. Central aortic pressure waveform was non-invasively obtained in healthy subjects (age range: 20-69 years old).

However, it has been show a great inter-subject variability limiting its clinical use. Carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (PWVcr) was proposed as an alternative tool for the evaluation of endothelial function. At the present, there is no doubt that PWVcr reduces its values in response to reactive hyperemia test (RHT) in healthy subjects. Aims: a) to determine simultaneously the temporal profile of FMD, PWVcr and shear rate in response to RHT and b) to describe and analyze how subjects FMD responders or non-responders behave regards to PWVcr changes. Methods: 34 healthy young subjects were included. The PWVcr (strain gauge mechanotransducers), brachial diameter (B-Mode ultrasound and blood flow velocity (Doppler ultrasound) were measured before (baseline) the cuff was inflated and after its deflation (5 minutes). 10 th percentiles FMD and PWVcr changes in the population were used for the definition of the subjects (responders and non-responders). Results: Changes in PWVcr, brachial arterial diameter and shear rate were evidenced after the cuff release (p0.05). There were differences in the PWV and FMD temporal profiles. Within FMD responders there were PWV responders and non-responders. Conclusion: Assessing RHT-related changes in PWVcr in the context of a FMD evaluation, could be useful as a discriminator of intrinsic wall alterations giving additional information of vascular dynamics. © 2011 IEEE."

The contouring technique is utilized to find an accurate contour and it is based on the polarization features of the twisted-nematic liquid-crystal displays (TNLCDs). TN-LCDs are manufactured to work between a crossed polarizer-analyzer pair. When the analyzer is at 45 deg (instead of 90 deg) with respect to the polarizer, one obtains an optically processed image with pronounced outlines (dark contours) at middle intensity. On other hand, the segmentation algorithms are based on active shape models or snakes. Experimental results show that the proposed technique yields accurate segmentation for low-contrast images. Also, we demonstrate that this hybrid-system has a better performance than purely digital algorithms. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)."

Recent studies have shown a decline in young people pursuing studies and careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The key to fight against this trend is to maximize on the enthusiasm of students in an engaging learning environment. Teaching methods such as hands-on learning teaches students to be the maker of things rather than the consumers. By providing innovative approaches that support science and technology education in schools, outreach efforts should aim to spark interest in space related activities among students. Current and future outreach programs should enable critical thinking, problem solving and support innovative learning. The focus of this paper will be to address the stereotypes associated with pursuing a career in space, as well as the issues and challenges of initiating and sustaining space education programs in developing nations. The 2010 Space Generation Congress (SGC) Outreach Working Group, comprising of enthusiastic students and young professionals in the space sector, identified critical problems in engaging the young generation in both developed and developing nations regarding space related topics. With an emphasis on breaking stereotypes and dispelling misconceptions and myths about working in the space sector, the group highlighted key challenges in the development of science and technology education. The Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC) Outreach Working Group put forward recommendations for the improvement of space education and outreach program in developing countries aimed to encourage the young generation of space enthusiasts in an interactive and easily-accessible way. The short video ""Space Is Not Just Rocket Science"" was developed by the Outreach Working Group showing people across the world, working in different professions, having one thing in common: They all work in the space sector. By voicing the youth's involvement in the space sector and breaking the stereotypes of what a career in the space industry entails, the video aimed to encourage young people to become part of the big space family, not necessarily as scientists and engineers but also as fashion designers, lawyers, researchers and many more occupations. The video is available on YouTube and can easily be accessed by students and educators around the world. The recommendations of the SGC Working Group seek to support ongoing outreach initiatives and provide new ideas on how to improve space education and outreach programs.

After passing through a bulk Faraday sensor head, the light travels through the free space reaching a Faraday modulator placed some distance away from the conductor carrying the current. The first device acts a current transducer and the second one acts as a magneto-optical element operated in a closed-loop mode to compensate the angle of rotation of the polarization introduced by the sensor head. The control system operates in closed loop feedback through a simple current-driven solenoid, and this way, the optical output from the current sensor is maintained at a constant intensity. Considering that the optical and electrical parameters of the sensor head and the Faraday modulator are known, the electrical current applied to the solenoid can be measured, and thus the current flowing through the conductor can be calculated. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed device to measure remotely the current carried by the conductor. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)."

In both cases there is a walker and a coin: at every time step the coin is tossed and the walker moves depending on the toss output. Unlike the RW, in the QW the walker and coin are quantum in nature what allows the coherent superpositions right/left and head/tail happen. This feature endows the QW with outstanding properties, such as making the standard deviation of the position of an initially localized walker grow linearly with time t, unlike the RW in which this growth goes as t1/2. This has strong consequences in algorithmics and is one of the reasons why QWs are receiving so much attention from the past decade. However the relevance of QW's is being recognized to go beyond this specific arena and, for example, some simple generalizations of the standard QW have shown unsuspected connections with phenomena such as Anderson localization and quantum chaos. Moreover, theoretical and experimental studies evidence that the QW finds applications in outstanding systems, such as Bose-Einstein condensates, atoms in optical lattices, trapped ions, or optical devices, just to mention a few (see [2] and references therein). Continuous versions of the QW exist as well, whose relationship with the discrete QW has been discussed in [3]. © 2011 IEEE."

The results indicate that the hydrogen is mainly segregated at the dislocation core, inhibiting the hydrogen Snoek-Köster relaxations verified at earlier ageing stages. Despite this, a contribution to viscosity in the kink-chain resonance is provided by the mobile hydrogen in the dislocation core by its side movement along the dislocation line. At temperatures at which the hydrogen begins to freeze in the lattice the geometrical kinks find a gradual increase on the hindering of their movements along dislocation lines, becoming immobile when the hydrogen is completely frozen in the crystal, anchoring the dislocations in short loops. Although the viscosity associated with the mobile hydrogen is removed, the resonance associated with geometrical kinks is not completely cancelled. The interaction of hydrogen-dislocation can be fully described in terms of kinks in dislocations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V."

Moreover, is especially important if such fibers are residues of agro-industrial processes. In this work a promising technique to develop HDPE matrix nanocomposites by addition natural fibers and clay nanoparticles prepared by extrusion process is described. The HDPE with 20 % (w/w) of sugarcane bagasse fiber from agro-industrial residues and 3 % (w/w) of bentonite chocolate organophilic nanoclay (Brazilian smectitic organophilic clay) addition were obtained using a twin-screw extruder machine type. After extrusion process, the composites were characterized by tensile and flexural tests, SEM, Vicat and HDT tests. The MFI tests were determined to evaluate the effects of fiber and organoclay addition on dynamic viscoelastic melt of the HDPE. The results showed that the thermo-mechanical properties of nanocomposites obtained were superior to those of the pure HDPE. © 2011 The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society."

Secondly, we consider a highly controlled case, where numbers of connections per route are actively controlled with feedback from the network, to serve a global notion of user welfare; we prove results on global stability for proposed decentralized control laws. Finally, an intermediate situation concerns exogenous loads subject to admission control by the network, with or without routing.

In previous works we demonstrated that changes in arterial wall viscosity and elasticity and/or in the filtering function (FF) could be in the basis of arterial wall alterations. If these properties are altered in arterial wall with atherosclerotic plaques remain to be analyzed. Our aims were to analyze, the arterial wall visco-elasticity and FF of human carotid arteries with atherosclerotic plaques. To this end, instantaneous arterial diameter waveforms were obtained non-invasively (B-Mode Echography), in five sites (S1-S5) on the carotid artery. After that, diameter waveform obtained in S1 (first segment of the common carotid artery) was calibrated using pressure values, and used to quantify the pressure-diameter relationship for each segment. From pressure-diameter relationships, viscosity, elasticity and FF were quantified. Central portions of atherosclerotic plaques showed a reduced FF. At least in theoretical terms, the FF reduction could be related with the plaque vulnerability. © 2010 IEEE."

This project correlates the influence of urban and marine meteorochemical parameters on the performance of reinforced concrete structures. The environment was evaluated using ISO Standard 9223 and the concrete was characterized physically by measuring compressive strength, elastic modulus, total and effective porosity, as well as resistance to water absorption. After a one-year exposure period, the results of the corrosion potentiality and probability analysis of the reinforcement in the different test stations show that the concrete prepared in Venezuela is the one that has the greatest probability of carbonation-induced corrosion of the reinforcement, with the test site at Cali, Colombia being the one that would induce least corrosion. These results are comparable with those found using electrochemical measurements, after a five-year exposure period. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, London."

We employ an inverse mathematical modeling approach on a four-parameter (linear) Kelvin viscoelastic model and two five-parameter nonlinear viscoelastic models (arctangent and sigmoid) to infer vascular biomechanical properties under in vivo and ex vivo experimental conditions in ten and eleven male Merino sheep, respectively. We used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as a goodnessof-fit measure. Results show that under both experimental conditions, the nonlinear models generally outperform the linear Kelvin model, as judged by the AIC. Furthermore, the sigmoid nonlinear viscoelastic model consistently achieves the lowest AIC and also matches the zero-stress vessel radii measured ex vivo. Based on these observations, we conclude that the sigmoid nonlinear viscoelastic model best describes the biomechanical properties of ovine large arteries under both experimental conditions considered in this study. © 2010 IEEE."

Although a variety of factors have been proposed as key factors in these process, the mechanism that contribute to this problem remain to be characterized. Previously we demonstrated that changes in arterial wall viscous and elastic properties and/or in the filtering function (FF) could be part of the arterial wall alterations basis. If these properties are altered in arteries with atherosclerotic plaques remains to be analyzed. Our aims were 1) to analyze the arterial wall visco-elasticity and FF of carotid and femoral segments with atherosclerotic plaques, 2) to compare them with the mechanical behavior of segments without plaques (from the same artery) and of healthy arteries studied non-invasively. To this end, in each arterial segment, pressure and diameter signals were obtained, in vitro (circulation mock) and in vivo (non-invasive recordings). In atherosclerotic arteries recordings were performed on plaques and near regions without plaques. In each segment, the elasticity, the viscosity, and the wall FF were quantified. Atherosclerotic vessels, and particularly plaque regions, showed a reduced viscosity and FF. At the light of our results, hypothetical links between plaque events and changes in visco-elasticity and FF were discussed. © 2010 IEEE."

The proposed methods are based on the polarization properties of the twisted-nematic liquid-crystal displays (LCDs). LCDs traduce the image information in changes of the state of polarization of the light, which allows us to generate simultaneously a ""positive"" and a ""negative"" (i.e., a contrast-reversed) replica of the digital image displayed on the LCD. In both methods negative and positive replicas are at the same time imagined across a plane. In first case when the negative replica has a lateral differential displacement relative to the original one, an image with enhanced first derivatives along a specific direction is obtained. In the case when the negative replica is low-pass filtered, one obtains the Laplacian of the original image. Unlike the usual Fourier (coherent) image processing, the technique proposed here works with incoherent illumination. Validation experiments are presented. © 2010 SPIE."

Increase in demand of electricity and lack of water in dams, due to climate variations, are the main factors behind the requirement of fuel for thermal generation in order to satisfy demand. Most of this uncertain demand of fuel must be purchased as a set of cargoes for a given period and the decision is typically taken two months before the arrival of the product. In the meantime, demand or production of fuel could change and the possibility of extra costs arises such as demurrages or cancellations due to capacity constraints. This paper presents a simplified multi-stage stochastic model that represents the problem of fuel procurement; whose decisions are based on a minimum expected cost criteria for a given set of scenarios."

Examples of DIS are the mediators, data warehouses, federations of databases, and web portals. Data quality is an essential issue in DIS as it concerns the confidence of users in the supplied information. One of the main challenges in this field is to offer rigorous and practical means to evaluate the quality of DIS. In this sense, DIS reliability intends to represent its capability for providing data with a certain level of quality, taking into account not only current quality values but also the changes that may occur in data quality at the external sources. Simulation techniques constitute a nontraditional approach to data quality evaluation, and more specifically for DIS reliability. This chapter presents techniques for DIS reliability evaluation by applying simulation techniques in addition to exact computation models. Simulation enables some important drawbacks of exact techniques to be addressed: the scalability of the reliability computation when the set of data sources grows, and modeling data sources with inter-related (non independent) quality properties. © Springer 2010."

Uruguay, Montevideo, Uruguay","The increasing number of wireless LANs using the same spectrum allocation could induce multiple interferences and it also could force the active LANs to continuously retransmit data to solve this problem, overloading the spectrum bands as well as collapsing their own transmission capacity. This upcoming problem can be mitigated by using different techniques, being site shielding one of them. If radio systems could be safeguarded against radiation from transmitter out of the specific network, the frequency reuse is improved and, as a consequence, the number of WLANs sharing the same area may increase maintaining the required quality standards. The proposal of this paper is the use of combined barriers constructed by bushes, supported by lattice structures, in order to attenuate signals from other networks and, so that, to defend the own wireless system from outer interferences. A measurement campaign has been performed in order to test this application of vegetal elements. This campaign was focused on determining the attenuation induced in the propagation channel by several configurations that combine six specimen of Ficus elastica and six structures made of four different materials. The wind effect on the canopies is also considered. Then, the relation between the induced attenuation and the interference from adjacent networks has been computed in terms of separation between networks. The network protection against outer unauthorised access could be also improved by means of the proposed technique."

For pasture-based dairy operations, estimating the amount of manure collected in the milking area is critical for designing management systems. With this aim, the ""average stay time"" concept was developed as a relevant parameter for the cattle on the milking area. It is possible to estimate the average milking time based on individual milking time, number of cows, number of milking units and batches used to divide the cattle. This time varied, from 0.7 to 3.6 h d-1 in the farms studied. The waste under local operating conditions was characterized with experimental data from five farms. An adjusted estimate for solids and nutrients was generated by normalizing the stay time. Mean values per cow per day for 2 h of average stay time were 590 g total solids (TS), 24.6 g total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), 400 g Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and 2.6 g total phosphorous (TP). Comparing data obtained using a standard estimate with this developed estimate, a reduction in standard deviation from 41 to 16% in TKN and 46 to 10% TS was obtained. The adjusted variables were tested from over a year on another farm, showing a significant improvement for estimates. © 2009 IAgrE."

Design/methodology/ approach - The Trefftz collocation method will be used to solve the governing differential equations of the problem. This method uses trial functions that satisfy, in a certain region the governing differential equations. Complete sets of solutions of such equations are required so that completeness and convergence can be guaranteed. The values of the wavenumbers for which the solution of the governing equation is unbounded, are those correspondent to the resonance frequencies of the antenna. After finding the wavenumbers, with the help of empirical correction formulas (because of the effect of the fringing field), the actual resonance frequencies are determined. Findings - The Trefftz collocation method was found to be a very simple, fast and accurate method for the computation of the electric field under the patch of a microstrip antenna. Results obtained from this method showed excellent accuracy with less computational effort than other methods previously used. Research limitations/implications - Although the resonance wavenumbers may be accurate for any shape of antenna (because of the method convergence), the resonance frequencies might not be so accurate for irregular shapes since the parameters of the empirical formulas are approximated. Also the resonant cavity model is only valid for antennas made of thin substrates. Originality/value - This formulation of the Trefftz method was for the first time applied to this problem, showing promising results. © 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved."

In this paper, we introduce a new Control Plane (CP) for LISP supported by an architecture that borrows concepts from both the Path Computation Element (PCE) and Intelligent Route Control (IRC). Our CP is able to tackle three different problems simultaneously: (i) packets sourced from end-hosts are neither dropped nor queued during the mapping resolution; (ii) the EID-to-RLOC mapping can be obtained and configured approximately within the DNS resolution time needed to fetch the destination EID address; and (iii) our approach can blend IRC with the PCE capabilities, to perform upstream/ downstream Traffic Engineering (TE) through the dynamic management of the mappings. In particular, our CP supports the utilization of different LISP ingress and egress local routers for the same flow sourced from a domain."

Montevideo, Uruguay","As IC technology scales down, interconnect issues are becoming one of the major concerns of gigahertz System-on-Chip (SoC) design. Voltage distortion (power supply noise) and delay violations (signal and clock skews) dramatically contribute to signal integrity loss. As a consequence, performance degradation, reliability problems and ultimately, functional error occur. In this paper1, we propose a new methodology to enhance SoC signal integrity with respect to power/ground voltage transients, without degrading its performance. The underlying principle of the proposed methodology is to dynamically adapt the clock duty-cycle (CDC) according to the signal propagation delay through the logic whose power supply voltage is being disturbed. The methodology is based on a clock stretching logic (CSL) block, which monitors abnormal power grid activity and increases clock duty-cycle accordingly. Moreover, a model to accurately quantify CDC stretching as a function of VDD/Gnd fluctuations is proposed. Practical experiments based on the implementation of a 32-bit pipeline processor in a FPGA IC were performed and demonstrate the circuit robustness enhancement to power line fluctuations while maintaining at-speed clock rate.© 2008 IEEE."

The steel structure foundations allow for a minimum interference with the expected underground finding of graves and burials. The masonry walls will be strengthened by mortar injection and tied by the insertion of twin steel beams at the floor levels, joined across the wall thickness by means of passing-through injected bars. A particular solution has been conceived based on the synergetic interaction between new and existing structure. Special connection systems between new structures and old masonry walls allow for a triple function: avoiding the interaction in the vertical load bearing capacity, avoiding collapse mechanism orthogonal to the wall plane through the horizontal bracing effect of the steel frame, using the horizontal load bearing capacity of the retrofitted and strengthened walls in their plane.

The aims were to characterize the LV systolic and diastolic torsion dynamic in professional soccer players using STE, and to analyze the main differences in torsion dynamics between soccer players and age-matched non-trained individuals. To this end the LV apical and basal rotation were quantified, and the systolic and diastolic torsion dynamic was characterized using a time and frequency-domain approach. The STE allowed characterizing the LV torsion level in both groups. The LV torsion level was lesser in soccer players than in non-trained individuals.

A problem from this equation is that only for antennas of certain regular shapes it does exist an analytical solution for the equation. For antennas of arbitrary shape we have to find a numerical solution, for which several methods have been proposed. In this paper, the Trefftz Collocation method will be used in order to solve the governing equation. The Trefftz Collocation method consists of the solution of a partial differential equation by the superposition of a number of functions, which are themselves solutions of the homogeneous governing equation, appropriately scaled by a number of unknown parameters. These unknowns are then obtained from the approximate satisfaction of the boundary conditions by means of collocation or in a weighted residual sense. The main characteristic of the Trefftz methods is, thus, the use of trial functions that satisfy, in a certain region all the governing differential equations of the problem. Complete sets of solutions of such partial differential equations are then required so that completeness and convergence can be guaranteed. The values of the wavenumbers for which the solution to the governing equation is unbounded, are those that correspond to the resonance frequencies of the antenna, frequencies for which the antenna is designed to operate. For this reason is important to find them. In addition, the correspondent eigenmodes determine the radiation pattern and input impedance. After finding the wavenumbers, with the help of empirical correction formulas for taking into account the effect of the fringing field, the actual resonance frequencies will be determined. Results will be compared to those given by several authors in the literature."

The induction heating equipment for surface hardening of metals and alloys using LF (medium frequencies in the jargon of induction heating) is composed by a coil or coil assembly and a power semiconductor driving system up to 50 kHz. The load seen by the driving system is equivalent to a transformer. The primary corresponds to the excitation coil or coil assembly, and the work piece corresponds to a short-circuited secondary. In these and others technical applications of Kelvin effect it is often necessary to be able to relate local skin depths with local curvatures of the surface of electrically conductive bodies. It was proposed recently a closed form analytical formula that relates the local skin depth with the local mean curvature and the well known skin depth for a flat conductive but non ferromagnetic body. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, improve and give a critical discussion of the derivation of the aforementioned analytical formula. Second, generalize it to bodies with magnetic hysteresis losses. Third, apply the above mentioned generalized formula to describe the electrical load seen by the driving system in the conditions used for surface hardening. The formulae given here could be applied to asses some characteristics of the load that may be of interest in the choice or design of the driving system, including the planning of digital simulations using complex computer codes. © 2007 Springer."

In both cases circuit design and measurement results are presented, showing an excellent performance in circuit simplicity, and noise to power consumption trade-off. The first circuit is a very simple Gm-C chopper low-pass amplifier for flicker noise cancellation. It consumes only 28mW, with a measured input referred noise and offset of 1.2 nV/√Hz , and 2.5μV, respectively. For the reduction of thermal noise with minimum power consumption, in the second circuit, a ultra-low noise amplifier, a energy-efficient DC-DC downconverter, and low voltage design techniques are combined.

They increase with the distance between the pacing cathode and the myocardium, and with the size of the electrode. Mathematical formulae that relate the time constants (and the chronaxies) of the strength duration curves with the parameters of the system composed by the electrode, the volume conductor and the myocardium are used to explain the aforementioned experimental results and to discuss, from an engineering standpoint, some aspects related with thresholds for cardiac pacing, both for unipolar and bipolar pacing. These formulae are derived from a mathematical model of the electric stimulation of a syncytium framed in the bidomain theory. The time constants are given as increasing functions of a non dimensional number, equal to the quotient between a a certain characteristic length and myocardium's space constant. In the case of pacing electrodes, the characteristic length is a function of the size and shape of a region of influence of the cathode on the excitable tissue located adjacent to the electrode. © 2006 IEEE."

A popular source of point clouds are three-dimensional shape acquisition devices such as laser range scanners. Another important field where point clouds are found is the representation of high-dimensional manifolds by samples. With the increasing popularity and very broad applications of this source of data, it is natural and important to work directly with this representation, without having to go through the intermediate and sometimes impossible and distorting steps of surface reconstruction. Under the assumption that the underlying object is a submanifold of Euclidean space, we first discuss how to approximately compute geodesic distances by using only the point cloud by which the object is represented. We give probabilistic error bounds under a random model for the sampling process. Later in the chapter we present a geometric framework for comparing manifolds given by point clouds. The underlying theory is based on Gromov—Hausdorff distances, leading to isometry invariant and completely geometric comparisons. This theory is embedded in a probabilistic setting, as derived from random sampling of manifolds, and then combined with results on matrices of pairwise geodesic distances to lead to a computational implementation of the framework. © 2006, Birkhäuser Boston."

Using a reliability estimation problem, we show that there exists some efficient estimators for which BRErr is not verified. The efficiency is due to the fact that the number of estimations during a given simulation time increases with the rarity.

ARPEL is developing the Contingency Planning Project (PLACON), which aims to ensure a timely, efficient, cost-effective, joint response for an oil spill emergency at both the company and regional levels. The project embraces the following topics: computerized resources inventory, sensitivity mapping, training courses, and regional integration analysis. Results of the PLACON project to date and the present situation of the companies surveyed are analyzed as they relate to the objectives of the project. Information about the oil spill contingency planning process of companies operating in countries responsible for 99.9% exportation and 85.3% importation of the crude oil in Latin America is evaluated. Data included are from companies whose operations represent approximately 91.5% of oil production and 89.9% of oil refining in the region."

The spill was caused by the collision of the tanker SAN JORGE against a rocky formation that did not appear on the nautical charts. This tanker, of Panamanian flag, was transporting 60,000 tons of Cañadon Seco crude oil from Comodoro Rivadavia (Argentina) to San Sebastian (Brazil). The collision caused initially a spill that was controlled with dispersants, but 2 days later adverse meteorological conditions drove the spill toward the coast, impacting an extension of 25 km. Floating booms were deployed before at the entrance of a creek and a lagoon, both of them of high ecological sensitivity, so it only remained to prepare cleanup actions at the beaches. These response actions had to be very quick because the spill occured in the middle of the summer, with Punta del Este full of tourists. The actions were successful, and in 2 weeks the beaches were kept almost completely clean."

A novel conditional sampling method based on a fuzzy clustering technique is presented in the chapter. The technique is applied to the analysis of the large-scale structures of the turbulent flow in an experimental model of a PCB enclosing. To overcome the limitations of the conventional (unconditional) time averaging, a set of conditionally sampled averages, or cluster averages, are obtained. The selected portion of the flow presented in this communication shows a re-circulation region beneath the plate at the entrance of the lower channel. Further, the time history of the flow is analyzed on the basis of this set of cluster averages, yielding time sequence relations among them that simplify their interpretation in terms of flow dynamics. In this way, events of alternate vortex shedding are identified in the selected portion of the flow. It is indicted that these events, which were hinted from the auto-correlation function, enhances the transport of heat beneath the plate, with respect to that which is produced by the mean flow. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

One part of the spilled volume reached the Pacific Ocean and the marine currents caused the oil slick to approach the Colombian coast, creating an environmental hazard. ECOPETROL (Empresa Colombiana de Petróleos) activated its contingency plan in the Port of Tumaco to meet the emergency. As a result of the above experience both companies signed a Mutual Cooperation Agreement to Combat and Control Oil Spills Caused by Oil Tankers and Coastal and Marine Oil Facilities, in October 1999. The Agreement was established in order to allow for a quick and effective joint response in emergency situations of this nature. The bilateral agreement is activated when resources, staff and equipment of the affected party are insufficient. At present it is under implementation. In addition, ECOPETROL and PETROECUADOR, as part of the regional cooperation process on oil spill contingency planning led by ARPEL in Latin America and the Caribbean, involved the Agreement in the framework of the environmental cooperation program with the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) to optimize such agreement.

An important application of those techniques is the formation of 3D echographic images. In a recent work we presented a statistical model to predict the spatial focusing of the time-reversed pulse and show the existence of a cut-off in the spatial frequencies caused by the existence of critical angles in the transmission function. In the solid-fluid interface, the high spatial frequencies are not transmitted to the fluid and generate an important limitation in the spatial focusing. A solution to overcome this limitation is to use rough surfaces in the interface. In this case, the waves are scattered by surface irregularities and all spatial frequencies are possible. In this work, we study the influence, in the time reversal focalization, of the roughness at the interface surface. We use spatial patterns corresponding to the longitudinal wavelength with a set of different (rms) roughness. A numerical simulation by finite elements is made to evaluate the experimental results in the time reversal processes. © 2005 IEEE."

Herrera y Reissig 565, Montevideo, Uruguay","Bunker fuel oil, one of the products of petroleum refining, has a strong impact on the production process because it drives the availability of heavy residues that depend on the crude quality. Based on the uncertainty of its demand, a stochastic model is proposed, where the benefit of the production is optimized, taking decision on the more suitable raw material, intermediate products and its final blend in order to fulfill the quality and demand requirements of final products. Three different crude qualities are supposed to be available for the first stage decision and their prices include an estimation of the storage cost for different scenarios. The optimum implies the most expensive quality to be bought due to a lack of incentive in the production of extra amounts of fuel oil at a non attractive price. Results are compared with the solution of a deterministic model with mean demand. In spite of being more complex than the deterministic model, the stochastic model solution's shows how the refinery should operate for each scenario of bunker fuel oil demand. Relative value between raw material and products, storage cost and some constraints in the demand have strong impact in the solution. Finally, a first approach to a procedure for building a stochastic model for linear programming packages, of common use in the refining industry, is exposed."

We propose a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) in order to approximately solve the proposed ANDP. The performance of our heuristic was tested on a testing set generated by customizing 210 SPG instances with different topological characteristics from SteinLib repository. The optimum values of the extracted SPG instances provide lower bounds for the designed ANDP instances.

Instantaneous pressure (Konigsberg) and diameter (sonomicrometry) signals were assessed in a wide range (0-60mmHg) of intravascular pressure. For each segment the low pressure range was set between 0mmHg and the breakpoint pressure and the high pressure range from the breakpoint pressure to 60mmHg.

First, the circular black spot used to stop the zero-order of diffracted light (Dark Field method) allows us to observe phase modulations in all directions perpendicular to the propagation of the beam. The classical ""knife edge"" of the Schlieren method shows phase modulations principally in one direction. This one is normal to the edge of the knife and normal to the light beam. On the other hand, PDF method uses short time illumination triggered by the acoustic pulse. This allows observing elastic fields in pulsed regime and we can evaluate the evolution of such pulse inside homogeneous and heterogeneous media. In this paper we apply PDF method to determine the conditions of change from single to multiple scattering. A 2.25 MHz transducer in water emits a wide-band ultrasonic pulse. By varying the distribution of scatterers (cylindrical wires of 1.2 mm diameter) it is possible to generate the conditions necessary for loosing coherence in the pulse.

A frequency response analysis followed the time-domain adaptation. Additionally, a viscoelastic model was proposed to characterize the arterial wall mechanical behavior, using the elastic (E) and viscous (η) moduli. Six merino sheep were instrumented and anesthetized. Pressure measurements were registered in both ventricles, in aorta and in the pulmonary artery. Diameters (sonomicrometry) were measured in both arteries. The frequency transfer function asymptotic negative slope, describing the attenuation within the dynamic range, resulted 5 times greater in aorta (p<0.05), what presents the systemic as a more selective circuit than the pulmonary. E and η resulted higher (p<0.05) in aorta than in the pulmonary artery whereas E/η) was similar. The viscoelastic results might indicate a similar segmental (unit-cell) response in both arteries. The enhanced cushioning ability of the left circuit with respect to the right, might be understood as a more selective vascular filtering system.

The structural quality and uniformity of the crystals was verified by chemical determination of etch pits density and by X-ray rocking curves. Inductively coupled plasma-Mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) was employed for evaluating the dopant concentration. Low temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements of the crystals were performed in the 1.2-1.6 eV energy range. The crystal electrical properties were studied by Hall and I-V measurements. The obtained PL data show a domination of (D-X) and (DAP) lines in CdTe crystals, suggesting n-type conductivity and the presence of a compensation mechanism due to the heavy dopant incorporation. Investigating the 1.4 eV band, we obtained the Huang-Rhys parameter, the principal energy of zero phonon line and the energy of longitudinal optical phonon for each dopant. Impurities were measured by ICP-MS. A particular PL line at 1.473 eV, correlated to MTe (M = heavy metal) defect centers, was found. It was found that the heavy metal doped CdTe crystals have resistivity values in the range 107-1010 Ω.cm, with maximum values for Bi and Hg doped materials. Also these materials show a higher dark current stability than the ones doped with the other heavy metals. Detectors made from Hg doped crystals gave response to X and γ radiation."

In both types, the total intensity shows random drops and then recovers gradually to its original value. But the two LFF types are clearly distinguished by the behavior of the x- and y-linearly polarized (LP) modes. Type I LFF is characterized by the fact that the x- and y-LP modes compete with nearly equal power, while type II LFF is characterized by intensity dropouts in the dominant polarization mode and intensity bursts in the depressed mode. We analyze the parameter regions in which these different LFF occur and characterize them further. Our numerical results suggest that a transition from one LFF type to the other may be experimentally observed by modifying the frequency difference and/or the gain-to-loss ratio of the two LP modes. The LFF we present is an example of vectorial chaos, which may be of use for multichannel secure communication systems using chaotic light."

Mining activity extends from copper and gold deposits located in the Atacama Desert 4.500 meters above sea level to underground coal workings beneath the sea floor. This diversity in location and environment presents many challenges in the development of competitive and environmentally sustainable mining activities. An important future issue will be how to close these mines in an appropriate way once economically exploitable ore reserves have been exhausted. This poses challenges for both the government and companies alike, considering that Chilean law currently lacks legislation specific to mine closure. This paper examines the risks associated with mine closure based on international experience, and identifies those risks specific to Chilean regions. The main regions in Chile where mine closure legislation should be applied are identified."

Platelets were grown from both synthesized lead iodide without purification and then purified by repeated evaporation. The growth was performed by heating the starting material at vacuum (10 -5 mmHg) or in high purity Ar atmosphere (500 mmHg) at temperatures from 390 to 430°C, during 5 to 20 days. Platelets grew at 200-250 °C and perpendicular to the ampoule wall. Platelet size is up to 13×8 mm 2 and their thickness is from 50 to 100 μm. Crystals were characterized by optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and low temperature photoluminescence. These characterizations showed that platelets have an exceptional transparence, that they grew from hexagonal grains and that their surface has a mean roughness of 4.6 nm. Low temperature photoluminescence was performed: peak position and broadness confirmed the high purity of the starting material and bands confirmed strong components from free and bonded excitons and low superficial imperfections ((Iex/Iimp)=6). Electrical properties were measured by fabricating radiation detectors with front palladium thermal deposition contacts and acrylic encapsulation. Resistivities of about 5 × 10 13 Ω. cm and current densities of 50 pA/cm 2 (10 V) were obtained. X-ray spectroscopy was performed with lead iodide detectors and an energy resolution of 1.2 keV was achieved for 241Am 18 keV radiation. Correlation between optical and surface properties and electrical parameters and detector performance are presented. Also, the different results were compared with previous ones for crystals grown by other methods and with alternative materials."

Depending on the operating conditions, the receiver laser intensity, IR(t), synchronizes with the intensity of the optically injected field, IT(t-τc) where τc is the flight time from the transmitter laser to the receiver laser, or synchronizes with IT(t-τc+τ), where τ is the external-cavity round-trip time. In the latter case, the intensity produced by the receiver anticipates the injected intensity IT(t-τc) by an anticipation time equal to τ. We find that synchronization with a lag time τc-τ is much more sensitive to frequency detuning and noise than synchronization with a lag time τc. Moreover, we also find that though synchronization with a lag time τc can be obtained using either an external-cavity or an open-loop receiver, the synchronization quality is always better when an external-cavity receiver is used. © 2002 SPIE · 0277-786X/02/$15.00."

The methylated fraction of exopolysaccharide was analyzed by TLC and was developed with sulfuric acid in ethanol. The TLC results show that the high molecular weight polymer is formed by glucose (RF = 0.30), glucuronic acid (RF = 0.19) and galactose (RF = 0.29). The methylated fraction of low molecular weight is a homopolymer with a degree of polymerization of 17. It is finally concluded from the study that the exopolysaccharide identified by TLC is a mixture of an homopolymer (glucose) and of heteropolymers (glucose, glucuronic acid, galactose)."

Current software designed to handle distributed applications does not focus on the problem of forecasting the computers future load. The software only dispatches the tasks assigning them either to an idle CPU (in dedicated networks) or to the lowest loaded one (in non-dedicated networks). Our approach tries to improve the standard dispatching strategies provided by both parallel languages and libraries, by implementing new dispatching criteria. It will choose the most suitable computer after forecasting the load of the individual machines based on current and historical data. Existing applications could take advantage of this new service with no extra changes but a recompilation. A fair comparison between different dispatching algorithms could only be done if they run over the same external network load conditions. In order to do so, a tool to arbitrarily replicate historical observations of load parameters while running the different strategies was developed. In this environment, the new algorithms are being tested and compared to verify the improvement over the dispatching strategy already available. The overall performance of the system was tested with in-house developed numerical models. The project reported here is connected with other efforts at CeCal devoted to make it easier for scientists and developers to gain advantage of parallel computing techniques using low cost components."

Several models for fingerprint codification based on minutiae characteristics were designed and implemented in this work. The ENH pre-processing software was used and tested and several improvements were implemented. The Competitive Selective neural network MCSL was used in the codification procedure in all models. A fingerprint variants generation procedure was also designed and implemented. It was used to generate a training set composed of 12 samples of each fingerprint selected from the standard database NIST 14. An identification system based on the Spiking Bayesian neural network SPIKE was used to test all codification models. The model based on minutiae direction provided the best performance and achieved the correct identification of 50% of a 12 fingerprint test set. For this model, both a Backpropagation Multilayer Perceptron MLP/BP neural network and SPIKE were tested on six 11 fingerprint test sets. Identification system performance depends heavily on image quality and the ability of the pre-processing software to obtain reliable minutiae in spite of image noise. Nevertheless, fingerprint identification using fingerprint coding based on minutiae direction turned out to be quite successful with a small set of fingerprints."

Two transitions coupled to right- and left- circularly polarized light are coupled by spin-flip processes, which are characterized by the spin relaxation rate, γs. With moderately strong optical feedback and close to the solitary laser threshold the laser dynamics depend significantly on the value of γs. For low spin relaxation rates the time-averaged intensity often shows abrupt dropouts, similar to those observed in edge-emitting semiconductor lasers. Underlying the dropouts there is antiphase competition between the time-averaged orthogonal linearly polarized components of the electric field. For large values of the spin relaxation rate the dropouts tend to disappear and the time-averaged intensity is constant or nearly constant, depending on the stability of the linearly polarized states of the laser without feedback."

This case study applies to a homogeneous coastal stretch of 80 kms long, north of Punta del Este. The main coastal features are three littoral lagoons, Jose Ignacio, Garzon and Rocha, whose mouths open and close by natural or antropic actions every year. The coastline is formed by 1-2 mm coarse sand on highly reflective beaches. Beach berm is overwashed by the SE storm waves. Landward there is a dune system. This beach-dune structure is approximately 100 m wide. At least three similar morphological structures may be landward identified, which were developed during a period of time when the sea level was about 5 m higher than today's sea level (approximately 5000 years BP). 14C technique applied to chalk samples shows a relative decrease of the sea level in the last 5000 years. Furthermore, gravimetric data shows that there is an anomaly, which supports the existence of an isostatic rise of the continental shelf. As a result, the Atlantic Ocean Coast of Uruguay is prograding. The beach coarse material is provided by the wave action from the continental shelf, while the fine dune material seems to be obtained from the erosion of the land weathered granite."

The results for Adaptive Logic Network (ALN) type binary networks with and without learning in hardware are presented. The designs were made on a hardware platform consisting of a PC compatible as the host computer and an ALTERA RIPP10 reconfigurable board with nine FLEX8K FPGAs and 512KB RAM. The different designs were run on the same hardware platform, taking advantage of its configurability. A software tool was developed to automatically convert the ALN network description resulting from the training process with the ATREE 2.7 for Windows software package into a hardware description file. This approach enables the easy generation of the hardware necessary to evaluate the very large combinatorial functions that results in an ALN. In an on-board learning version, an ALN basic node was designed optimizing it in the amount of cells per node used. Several nodes connected in a binary tree structure for each output bit, together with a control block, form the ALN network. The total amount of logic available on-board in the used platform limits the maximum size of the networks from a small to medium range. The performance was studied in pattern recognition applications. The results are compared with the software simulation of ALN networks."

Developing countries face severe problems in their goal of assuring access to quality healthcare to their citizens. Nor is it comforting to look to the example of the developed countries, themselves uncomfortable with the tremendous commitment of resources that they use. It seems clear that if developing countries are to succeed their systems for assuring health will need to achieve radical improvements over those currently employed by the developed countries. They need to build systems that are directed to the heart of the problems; they need to make the best use of their existing human and economic resources; and they need to do this while respecting the human potential and aspirations of their people. Any such system will need to be built around planning, organizing and measuring the long-term, rather than episodic, health of citizens. In particular, health interventions need to be moved upstream where they are more effective and less expensive. The job of health informatics is to provide the fundamental enabling infrastructure that would allow individuals to cooperate in the fluid, effective ways required. We describe some of the requisites for such a system. Certainly, its construction will depend on the use of an open, standardsbased distributed object software architecture. © 1998 IMIA.

The detection of partial discharge activity in the insulation can give a closer knowledge of the defects in stator winding insulation. In the past few years digital techniques for the acquisition of the partial discharge signals have been developed. The statistical processing of this data allows a better understanding of the phenomena in the insulation. In this paper a digital implementation of a method for the measurement of partial discharges is shown. Conventional digital oscilloscopes can be used as an interesting alternative instead of using expensive dedicated electronics. A software package has been developed for the statistical analysis of the discharges. In the past few years new parameters have been used. The software calculates these meters from the statistical analysis in order to make a more precise diagnostic of the insulation condition. The system has been used during field tests in different types of generators and also in laboratory tests. The calibration of the measuring system and its related problems are discussed. Electronic pulse generators are commonly used for the calibration of the system but in complex systems many new problems arise. The reflection and attenuation of pulses make it difficult for the system to correctly detect the discharges.

In our experimental device we use a sound wavelength in water greater than 1.5 mm, generated by a PZT transducer. We can resolve an array of 1.0 mm of periodicity."

Parameters such as peak current, peak time and welding speed were considered and the effects of mean current, mean power and welding energy on weld bead penetration were analyzed. Results show that mean current and mean power are the controlling factors of weld bead penetration. However, penetration is directly related to the welding energy, independent of the welding speed. Thus, the welding energy is a more appropriate parameter for determining weld penetration."

In the case of piezocomposites plates, lateral resonances are generated by multiple Bragg scattering of Lamb waves. Plates samples in polyurethane - PZT5A have been prepared with a ceramic square rod geometry. The individual elements are excited by electrical and ultrasound pulses. The electrical cross-coupling characteristics are analysed. We identified two separate cross-coupling waves. These experimental results are compared with there obtained with an acoustic measurements at the received waves by neighbours elements of the excited. In this paper we can clearly see the origin at each lateral waves which produce the multiple Bragg scattering."

The motion of the boundary layer of the liquid induced by the acoustic pressure, modulates the phase of a collimated laser beam. This phase modulation is observed using dark-ground techniques, and it gives a measurement of the acoustic power as function of the position. Experiments with piezocomposite 1-3 transducers were carried out. The technique presented in this work is able to give quickly quantitative information about the motion of individual ceramic rods of the piezocomposite, and allow a fast quality control for piezocomposite 1-3 transducers. We achieved a lateral resolution of 0.2 × 0.4 mm. The theoretical limit for the axial resolution is of few Angstroms."

This involves training technicians obliged to work with codes, and quite frequently the equipment is discontinued before users have learned to handle the configuration techniques properly. The LEP language is a simple, declarative language designed to define the routing and customizing rules of a telex exchange, but the concepts employed can easily be applied to telephony or data transmission. This paper discusses the general abstraction used in this language based on the present packet switching experience.

The model is applied to explain the different location that the flow axial symmetry loss has in cylindrical tubes compared with divergent cones. The paper reports about the first results obtained in the way of understanding the fundamental phenomena that the industrial draft tube oscillatory behavior presents. The main purpose of the work is to understand the fundamental characteristics of this type of flows and to apply them to the draft tube vortex that appears in Francis turbines when they operate out of the design range."
