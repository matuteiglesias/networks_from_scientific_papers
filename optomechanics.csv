Back-action cooling, for example, is being pursued as a means of achieving the quantum ground state of macroscopic mechanical oscillators. Work in the optical domain has revolved around millimetre- or micrometre-scale structures using the radiation pressure force. By comparison, in microwave devices, low-loss superconducting structures have been used for gradient-force-mediated coupling to a nanomechanical oscillator of picogram mass. Here we describe measurements of an optical system consisting of a pair of specially patterned nanoscale beams in which optical and mechanical energies are simultaneously localized to a cubic-micron-scale volume, and for which large per-photon optical gradient forces are realized. The resulting scale of the per-photon force and the mass of the structure enable the exploration of cavity optomechanical regimes in which, for example, the mechanical rigidity of the structure is dominantly provided by the internal light field itself. In addition to precision measurement and sensitive force detection, nano-optomechanics may find application in reconfigurable and tunable photonic systems, light-based radio-frequency communication and the generation of giant optical nonlinearities for wavelength conversion and optical buffering. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

So far, most experimental studies of optomechanics have focused on measurement and control of the mechanical subsystem through its interaction with optics, and have led to the experimental demonstration of dynamical back-action cooling and optical rigidity of the mechanical system. Conversely, the optical response of these systems is also modified in the presence of mechanical interactions, leading to effects such as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and parametric normal-mode splitting. In atomic systems, studies of slow and stopped light (applicable to modern optical networks and future quantum networks) have thrust EIT to the forefront of experimental study during the past two decades. Here we demonstrate EIT and tunable optical delays in a nanoscale optomechanical crystal, using the optomechanical nonlinearity to control the velocity of light by way of engineered photon-""phonon interactions. Our device is fabricated by simply etching holes into a thin film of silicon. At low temperature (8.7 kelvin), we report an optically tunable delay of 50 nanoseconds with near-unity optical transparency, and superluminal light with a 1.4 microsecond signal advance. These results, while indicating significant progress towards an integrated quantum optomechanical memory, are also relevant to classical signal processing applications. Measurements at room temperature in the analogous regime of electromagnetically induced absorption show the utility of these chip-scale optomechanical systems for optical buffering, amplification, and filtering of microwave-over-optical signals. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Central to this effort is the necessity of long-lived mechanical states. Previous efforts have witnessed quantum behaviour, but for a low-quality-factor mechanical system. The field of cavity optomechanics and electromechanics, in which a high-quality-factor mechanical oscillator is parametrically coupled to an electromagnetic cavity resonance, provides a practical architecture for cooling, manipulation and detection of motion at the quantum level. One requirement is strong coupling, in which the interaction between the two systems is faster than the dissipation of energy from either system. Here, by incorporating a free-standing, flexible aluminium membrane into a lumped-element superconducting resonant cavity, we have increased the single-photon coupling strength between these two systems by more than two orders of magnitude, compared to previously obtained coupling strengths. A parametric drive tone at the difference frequency between the mechanical oscillator and the cavity resonance dramatically increases the overall coupling strength, allowing us to completely enter the quantum-enabled, strong-coupling regime. This is evidenced by a maximum normal-mode splitting of nearly six bare cavity linewidths. Spectroscopic measurements of these ĝ€̃ dressed states' are in excellent quantitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions. The basic circuit architecture presented here provides a feasible path to ground-state cooling and subsequent coherent control and measurement of long-lived quantum states of mechanical motion. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Here, we demonstrate purely dispersive coupling of high-Q nanomechanical oscillators to an ultrahigh-finesse optical microresonator via its evanescent field, extending cavity optomechanics to nanomechanical oscillators. Dynamical backaction mediated by the optical dipole force is observed, leading to laser-like coherent nanomechanical oscillations solely due to radiation pressure. Moreover, sub-fm Hz 1/2 displacement sensitivity is achieved, with a measurement imprecision equal to the standard quantum limit (SQL), which coincides with the nanomechanical oscillators zero-point fluctuations. The achievement of an imprecision at the SQL and radiation-pressure dynamical backaction for nanomechanical oscillators may have implications not only for detecting quantum phenomena in mechanical systems, but also for a variety of other precision experiments. Owing to the flexibility of the near-field coupling platform, it can be readily extended to a diverse set of nanomechanical oscillators. In addition, the approach provides a route to experiments where radiation-pressure quantum backaction dominates at room temperature, enabling ponderomotive squeezing or quantum non-demolition measurements. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The optical dipole force on the atoms together with the backaction of atomic motion onto the light field gives rise to a complex nonlinear coupled dynamics. As the resonator constitutes an open driven and damped system, the dynamics is nonconservative and in general enables cooling and confining the motion of polarizable particles. In addition the emitted cavity field allows for real-time monitoring of the particle's position with minimal perturbation up to subwavelength accuracy. For many-body systems, the resonator field mediates controllable long-range atom-atom interactions, which set the stage for collective phenomena. Besides the correlated motion of distant particles, one finds critical behavior and nonequilibrium phase transitions between states of different atomic order in conjunction with superradiant light scattering. Quantum-degenerate gases inside optical resonators can be used to emulate optomechanics as well as novel quantum phases such as supersolids and spin glasses. Nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions as predicted by, e.g., the Dicke Hamiltonian can be controlled and explored in real time via monitoring the cavity field.

To this end, a mechanical resonator has to be cooled to its ground state and its position has to be measured with great accuracy. Currently, various routes to reach these goals are being explored. In this review, we discuss different techniques for sensitive position detection and we give an overview of the cooling techniques that are being employed. The latter includes sideband cooling and active feedback cooling. The basic concepts that are important when measuring on mechanical systems with high accuracy and/or at very low temperatures, such as thermal and quantum noise, linear response theory, and backaction, are explained. From this, the quantum limit on linear position detection is obtained and the sensitivities that have been achieved in recent opto- and nanoelectromechanical experiments are compared to this limit. The mechanical resonators that are used in the experiments range from meter-sized gravitational wave detectors to nanomechanical systems that can only be read out using mesoscopic devices such as single-electron transistors or superconducting quantum interference devices. A special class of nanomechanical systems is bottom-up fabricated carbon-based devices, which have very high frequencies and yet a large zero-point motion, making them ideal for reaching the quantum regime. The mechanics of some of the different mechanical systems at the nanoscale is studied. We conclude this review with an outlook of how state-of-the-art mechanical resonators can be improved to study quantum mechanics. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Active feedback cooling; Macroscopic quantum mechanical effects; Nano-electromechanical systems; NEMS; Optomechanics; QEMS; Quantum-electromechanical systems; Quantum-limited displacement detection; Sideband cooling",

This paper describes the way in which they differ from other optical media, and clarifies what they can do. In particular, three important issues are considered: light confinement, frequency dispersion and spatial dispersion. First, I describe the latest status and impact of ultra-strong light confinement in a wavelength-cubic volume achieved in photonic crystals. Second, the extreme reduction in the speed of light is reported, which was achieved as a result of frequency dispersion management. Third, strange negative refraction in photonic crystals is introduced, which results from their unique spatial dispersion, and it is clarified how this leads to perfect imaging. The last two sections are devoted to applications of these novel properties. First, I report the fact that strong light confinement and huge light-matter interaction enhancement make strongly modulated photonic crystals promising for on-chip all-optical processing, and present several examples including all-optical switches/memories and optical logics. As a second application, it is shown that the strong light confinement and slow light in strongly modulated photonic crystals enable the adiabatic tuning of light, which leads to various novel ways of controlling light, such as adiabatic frequency conversion, efficient optomechanics systems, photon memories and photons pinning. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,

In closely spaced devices, the coupling between the guided lightwaves gives rise to an optical force known as the optical bonding force. Indeed, attractive optical force has been observed in substrate coupled devices. According to recent theoretical predictions, the optical force should show bipolar behaviour depending on the relative phase between in-plane coupled lightwaves. So far, such an in-plane optical force has not been measured. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a bipolar optical force between planarly coupled nanophotonic waveguides. Both attractive and repulsive optical forces are obtained. The sign of the force can be switched reversibly by tuning the relative phase of the interacting lightwaves.

However, the principle of linear superposition, a central tenet of the theory, apparently contradicts a commonplace observation: macroscopic objects are never found in a linear superposition of position states. Moreover, the theory does not explain why during a quantum measurement, deterministic evolution is replaced by probabilistic evolution, whose random outcomes obey the Born probability rule. In this article a review is given of an experimentally falsifiable phenomenological proposal, known as continuous spontaneous collapse: a stochastic nonlinear modification of the Schrödinger equation, which resolves these problems, while giving the same experimental results as quantum theory in the microscopic regime. Two underlying theories for this phenomenology are reviewed: trace dynamics and gravity-induced collapse. As the macroscopic scale is approached, predictions of this proposal begin to differ appreciably from those of quantum theory and are being confronted by ongoing laboratory experiments that include molecular interferometry and optomechanics. These experiments, which test the validity of linear superposition for large systems, are reviewed here, and their technical challenges, current results, and future prospects summarized. It is likely that over the next two decades or so, these experiments can verify or rule out the proposed stochastic modification of quantum theory. © 2013 American Physical Society.",,"Experimental test; Laboratory experiments; Linear superpositions; Macroscopic objects; Probability rules; Quantum measurement; Stochastic modifications; Technical challenges; Experiments; Nonlinear equations; Stochastic systems; Quantum theory"

These systems are often not naturally compatible with one another and require a means of converting photons of dissimilar wavelengths to combine and exploit their different strengths. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate coherent wavelength conversion of optical photons using photon-phonon translation in a cavity-optomechanical system. For an engineered silicon optomechanical crystal nanocavity supporting a 4-GHz localized phonon mode, optical signals in a 1.5 MHz bandwidth are coherently converted over a 11.2 THz frequency span between one cavity mode at wavelength 1,460 nm and a second cavity mode at 1,545 nm with a 93% internal (2% external) peak efficiency. The thermal- and quantum-limiting noise involved in the conversion process is also analysed, and in terms of an equivalent photon number signal level are found to correspond to an internal noise level of only 6 and 4 × 10-3 quanta, respectively. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Work towards this goal has focused on increasing the strength of the coupling between the mechanical and optical degrees of freedom. However, the form of this coupling is crucial in determining which phenomena can be observed in such a system. Here we demonstrate that avoided crossings in the spectrum of an optical cavity containing a flexible dielectric membrane enable us to realize several different forms of the optomechanical coupling. These include cavity detunings that are (to lowest order) linear, quadratic or quartic in the membrane's displacement, and a cavity finesse that is linear in (or independent of) the membrane's displacement. All these couplings are realized in a single device with extremely low optical loss and can be tuned over a wide range in situ. In particular, we find that the quadratic coupling can be increased three orders of magnitude beyond previous devices. As a result of these advances, the device presented here should be capable of demonstrating the quantization of the membrane's mechanical energy. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, quantum optical effects in optomechanical systems have remained obscure, because their detection requires the object-s motion to be dominated by vacuum fluctuations in the optical radiation pressure; so far, direct observations have been stymied by technical and thermal noise. Here we report an implementation of cavity optomechanics using ultracold atoms in which the collective atomic motion is dominantly driven by quantum fluctuations in radiation pressure. The back-action of this motion onto the cavity light field produces ponderomotive squeezing. We detect this quantum phenomenon by measuring sub-shot-noise optical squeezing. Furthermore, the system acts as a low-power, high-gain, nonlinear parametric amplifier for optical fluctuations, demonstrating a gain of 20-dB with a pump corresponding to an average of only seven intracavity photons.

We consider a setup in this regime comprising two optical modes and one mechanical mode. For mechanical frequencies nearly resonant to the optical level splitting, we find the photon-phonon and the photon-photon interactions to be significantly enhanced. In addition to dispersive phonon detection in a novel regime, this offers the prospect of optomechanical photon measurement.

Being initially intended mainly to achieve negative refraction, the concept of metamaterials quickly covered a much broader range of applications, from microwaves to optics and even acoustics. In particular, nonlinear metamaterials established a new research direction giving rise to fruitful ideas for tunable and active artificial materials. Here we introduce the concept of magnetoelastic metamaterials, where a new type of nonlinear response emerges from mutual interaction. This is achieved by providing a mechanical degree of freedom so that the electromagnetic interaction in the metamaterial lattice is coupled to elastic interaction. This enables the electromagnetically induced forces to change the metamaterial structure, dynamically tuning its effective properties.

In the past years, CQED has attracted attention especially owing to its importance for the field of quantum information. At present, photons are the best carriers of quantum information between physically separated sites and quantum-information processing using stationary qubits is most promising, with the furthest advances having been made with trapped ions. The implementation of complex quantum-information-processing networks hence requires devices to efficiently couple photons and stationary qubits. Here, we present the first CQED experiments demonstrating that the collective strong-coupling regime can be reached in the interaction between a solid in the form of an ion Coulomb crystal and an optical field. The obtained coherence times are in the millisecond range and indicate that Coulomb crystals positioned inside optical cavities are promising for realizing a variety of quantum-information devices, including quantum repeaters and quantum memories for light.

Efficient up-conversion of radio-frequency signals to an optical carrier would enable their transmission through optical fibres instead of through copper wires, drastically reducing losses, and would give access to the set of established quantum optical techniques that are routinely used in quantum-limited signal detection. Research in cavity optomechanics has shown that nanomechanical oscillators can couple strongly to either microwave or optical fields. Here we demonstrate a room-temperature optoelectromechanical transducer with both these functionalities, following a recent proposal using a high-quality nanomembrane. A voltage bias of less than 10 V is sufficient to induce strong coupling between the voltage fluctuations in a radio-frequency resonance circuit and the membrane's displacement, which is simultaneously coupled to light reflected off its surface. The radio-frequency signals are detected as an optical phase shift with quantum-limited sensitivity. The corresponding half-wave voltage is in the microvolt range, orders of magnitude less than that of standard optical modulators. The noise of the transducer-beyond the measured Johnson noise of the resonant circuit-consists of the quantum noise of light and thermal fluctuations of the membrane, dominating the noise floor in potential applications in radio astronomy and nuclear magnetic imaging. Each of these contributions is inferred to be when balanced by choosing an electromechanical cooperativity of with an optical power of 1 mW. The noise temperature of the membrane is divided by the cooperativity. For the highest observed cooperativity of, this leads to a projected noise temperature of 40 mK and a sensitivity limit of.

A basic instance is that of interacting harmonic oscillators, giving rise to, for example, the phonon eigenmodes in a lattice. Of particular importance are the interactions in hybrid quantum systems, which can combine the benefits of each part in quantum technologies. Here we investigate a hybrid optomechanical system having three degrees of freedom, consisting of a microwave cavity and two micromechanical beams with closely spaced frequencies around 32ĝ€‰MHz and no direct interaction. We record the first evidence of tripartite optomechanical mixing, implying that the eigenmodes are combinations of one photonic and two phononic modes.

Simultaneously, we operate the nearly macroscopic mechanical modes close to the motional quantum ground state, down to 1.8 thermal quanta, achieved by back-action cooling.

A strong laser drive red detuned by twice the mechanical frequency from the cavity resonance frequency makes two-phonon processes resonant, which leads to a nonlinear version of optomechanically induced transparency. This effect provides a new method of measuring the average phonon number of the mechanical oscillator. Furthermore, we show that if the strong laser drive is detuned by half the mechanical frequency, optomechanically induced transparency also occurs due to resonant two-photon processes. The cavity response to a second probe drive is in this case nonlinear in the probe power.

Topological states have already been observed for electrons, atoms, and photons. It is an outstanding challenge to create a Chern insulator of sound waves in the solid state. In this work, we propose an implementation based on cavity optomechanics in a photonic crystal. The topological properties of the sound waves can be wholly tuned in situ by adjusting the amplitude and frequency of a driving laser that controls the optomechanical interaction between light and sound. The resulting chiral, topologically protected phonon transport can be probed completely optically. Moreover, we identify a regime of strong mixing between photon and phonon excitations, which gives rise to a large set of different topological phases and offers an example of a Chern insulator produced from the interaction between two physically distinct particle species, photons and phonons.","Nanophysics; Photonics; Topological insulators","Light; Phonons; Photonics; Photons; Cavity optomechanics; Nanophysics; Phonon excitations; Phonon transport; Topological insulators; Topological phasis; Topological properties; Topological state; Topology"

However, silicon is limited to wavelengths above 1.1μm and does not allow device operation in the visible spectrum range where low-noise lasers are conveniently available. The narrow bandgap of silicon also makes silicon optomechanical devices susceptible to strong two-photon absorption and free carrier absorption, which often introduce strong thermal effects that limit the devices' stability and cooling performance. Further, silicon also does not provide the desired lowest order optical nonlinearity for interfacing with other active electrical components on a chip. On the other hand, aluminum nitride (AlN) is a wide-band semiconductor widely used in micromechanical resonators due to its low mechanical loss and high electromechanical coupling strength. In this paper, we report the development of AlN-on-silicon platform for low loss, wide-band optical guiding, as well as its use for achieving simultaneously high-optical-qualityfactor and high-mechanical-quality-factor optomechanical devices. Exploiting AlN's inherent second-order nonlinearity we further demonstrate electro-optic modulation and efficient second harmonic generation in AlN photonic circuits.

Among their physical implementations, optomechanical (OM) crystals built on semiconductor slabs enable the integration and manipulation of multiple OM elements in a single chip and provide gigahertz phonons suitable for coherent phonon manipulation. Different demonstrations of coupling of infrared photons and gigahertz phonons in cavities created by inserting defects on OM crystals have been performed. However, the considered structures do not show a complete phononic bandgap, which should enable longer lifetimes, as acoustic leakage is minimized. Here we demonstrate the excitation of acoustic modes in a one-dimensional OM crystal properly designed to display a full phononic bandgap for acoustic modes at 4 GHz. The modes inside the complete bandgap are designed to have high-mechanical Q-factors, limit clamping losses and be invariant to fabrication imperfections. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"acoustic method; crystal; electronic equipment; infrared radiation; one-dimensional modeling; acoustics; article; crystal; excitation; infrared radiation; optics; optomechanical crystal; phonon; photon"

Such back-action-evading or quantum non-demolition measurements were first introduced in the 1970s for gravitational wave detection, and now such techniques are an indispensable tool throughout quantum science. Here we perform measurements of the position of a mechanical oscillator using pulses of light with a duration much shorter than a period of mechanical motion. Utilizing this back-action-evading interaction, we demonstrate state preparation and full state tomography of the mechanical motional state. We have reconstructed states with a position uncertainty reduced to 19 pm, limited by the quantum fluctuations of the optical pulse, and we have performed 'cooling-by-measurement' to reduce the mechanical mode temperature from an initial 1,100 to 16 K.

We propose and theoretically explore a realization of this system in the optical domain, using a combined Michelson-Sagnac interferometer, which enables a strong and tunable dissipative coupling. Quantum interference in such a setup results in the suppression of the lower motional sideband, leading to strongly enhanced cooling in the non-sideband-resolved regime. With state-of-the-art parameters, ground-state cooling and low-power quantum-limited position transduction are both possible. The possibility of a strong, tunable dissipative coupling opens up a new route towards observation of such fundamental optomechanical effects as nonlinear dynamics.

An optical cavity with a mechanically compliant boundary enhances the optomechanical interaction, which gives rise to qualitatively new behavior which can modify the dynamics of the mechanical motion. As early as 1967, in a pioneering work, V. Braginsky analyzed theoretically the role of radiation pressure in the interferometric measurement process, but it has remained experimentally unexplored for many decades. Here, we use whispering-gallery mode optical microresonators to study these radiation pressure phenomena. Optical microresonators simultaneously host optical and mechanical modes, which are systematically analyzed and optimized to feature ultra-low mechanical dissipation, photon storage times exceeding the mechanical oscillation period (i.e. the ""resolved-sideband regime"") and large optomechanical coupling. In this manner, it is demonstrated for the first time that dynamical backaction can be employed to cool mechanical modes, i.e., to reduce their thermally excited random motion. Utilizing this novel technique together with cryogenic pre-cooling of the mechanical oscillator, the phonon occupation of mechanical radial-breathing modes could be reduced to 〈 n〉 =63±20 excitation quanta. The corresponding displacement fluctuations are monitored interferometrically with a sensitivity at the level of 1{dot operator}10-18m/Hz, which is below the standard quantum limit (SQL). This implies that the readout is already in principle sufficient to measure the quantum mechanical zero-point position fluctuations of the mechanical mode.

However, the lack of heteroepitaxial growth and scalable fabrication techniques remains the major limiting factors preventing more wide-spread development and application of diamond photonics. In this work, we overcome this difficulty by adapting angled-etching techniques, previously developed for realization of diamond nanomechanical resonators, to fabricate racetrack resonators and photonic crystal cavities in bulk single-crystal diamond. Our devices feature large optical quality factors, in excess of 105, and operate over a wide wavelength range, spanning visible and telecom.

However, optomechanical oscillations by light pressure were not shown with liquids. This is because replacing the surrounding air with water inherently increases the acoustical impedance and hence, the associated acoustical radiation losses. Here, we bridge between microfluidics and optomechanics by fabricating a hollow-bubble resonator with liquid inside and optically exciting vibrations with 100 MHz rates using only mW optical-input power. This constitutes the first time that any microfluidic system is optomechanically actuated. We further prove the feasibility of microfluidic optomechanics on liquids by demonstrating vibrations on organic fluids with viscous dissipation higher than blood viscosity while measuring density changes in the liquid via the vibration frequency shift. Our device will enable using cavity optomechanics for studying non-solid phases of matter, while light is easily coupled from the outer dry side of the capillary and fluid is provided using a standard syringe pump. © 2013 CIOMP.

Cooling of composite metal-semiconductor mirrors, dielectric mirrors and dielectric membranes has been demonstrated. Here we report cavity cooling of mechanical modes in a high-quality-factor and optically active semiconductor nanomembrane. The cooling is a result of electron-hole generation by cavity photons. Consequently, the cooling factor depends on the optical wavelength, varies drastically in the vicinity of the semiconductor bandgap, and follows the excitonic absorption behaviour. The resultant photo-induced rigidity is large and a mode temperature cooled from room temperature down to 4ĝ€‰K is realized with 50ĝ€‰1/4W of light and a cavity finesse of just 10. Thermal stress due to non-radiative relaxation of the electron-hole pairs is the primary cause of the cooling.

We adopt such a classical picture of a radiating dipole oscillator to derive explicit expressions for the coupling of single atoms and atomic ensembles to Gaussian modes in free space and in an optical resonator. The cooperativity parameter of cavity QED is shown to play a central role and is given a geometrical interpretation. The classical analysis yields transparent, intuitive results that are useful for analyzing applications of cavity QED such as atom detection and counting, cavity cooling, cavity spin squeezing, cavity spin optomechanics, or phase transitions associated with the self-organization of the ensemble-light system. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Atom-light interaction; Cavity cooling; Cavity QED",

Pioneering photon counting experiments, such as the intensity interferometry performed by Hanbury Brown and Twiss to measure the angular width of visible stars, have played a critical role in our understanding of the full quantum nature of light. As with matter at the atomic scale, the laws of quantum mechanics also govern the properties of macroscopic mechanical objects, providing fundamental quantum limits to the sensitivity of mechanical sensors and transducers. Current research in cavity optomechanics seeks to use light to explore the quantum properties of mechanical systems ranging in size from kilogram-mass mirrors to nanoscale membranes, as well as to develop technologies for precision sensing and quantum information processing. Here we use an optical probe and single-photon detection to study the acoustic emission and absorption processes in a silicon nanomechanical resonator, and perform a measurement similar to that used by Hanbury Brown and Twiss to measure correlations in the emitted phonons as the resonator undergoes a parametric instability formally equivalent to that of a laser. Owing to the cavity-enhanced coupling of light with mechanical motion, this effective phonon counting technique has a noise equivalent phonon sensitivity of 0.89 ± 0.05. With straightforward improvements to this method, a variety of quantum state engineering tasks using mesoscopic mechanical resonators would be enabled, including the generation and heralding of single-phonon Fock states and the quantum entanglement of remote mechanical elements. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The squeezing of the cavity mode can enhance the interaction strength into the single-photon strong-coupling regime, even when the OMS is originally in the weak-coupling regime. Moreover, the noise of the squeezed mode can be suppressed completely by introducing a broadband-squeezed vacuum environment that is phase matched with the parametric amplification that squeezes the cavity mode. This proposal offers an alternative approach to control the OMS using a squeezed cavity mode, which should allow single-photon quantum processes to be implemented with currently available optomechanical technology.

The long-time solution reveals detailed physical processes involved as well as the corresponding resonant photon frequencies. We characterize the photon correlation induced in the scattering process by calculating the two-photon joint spectrum of the long-time state. Clear evidence for photon frequency anticorrelation can be observed in the joint spectrum. In addition, we calculate the equal-time second-order correlation function of the cavity photons.

However, current implementation of cavity optomechanics achieves both excitation and detection only in a narrow band at the cavity resonance.

Furthermore, an optically trapped particle in vacuum may rotate freely, a unique property that does not exist in clamped mechanical oscillators. In this review, we will introduce the current status of optical trapping of dielectric particles in air and vacuum, Brownian motion of an optically trapped particle at room temperature, Feedback cooling and cavity cooling of the Brownian motion.

Via feeding broadband squeezed-vacuum light accompanying a coherent driving laser field into the cavity, the master equation for the cavity-mirror system is derived by following the general reservoir theory. When the mirror is weakly coupled to the cavity mode, we find that the driven cavity field can effectively perform as a squeezed-vacuum reservoir for the movable mirror via utilizing the completely destructive interference of quantum noise. Efficient transfer of squeezing from the light to the movable mirror occurs, irrespective of the ratio between the cavity damping rate and the mechanical frequency. Moreover, when the mirror is moderately coupled to the cavity mode, photonic excitation can preclude the completely destructive interference of quantum noise.

As an example, a Bragg mirror used at the long wavelength edge of its band stop can be efficiently optically cooled using the Doppler friction. The opposite effect opens new routes for optical pumping of mechanical systems: a laser pointing at a Bragg mirror and tuned at its short wavelength edge induces amplification of the vibrational excitation of the mirror leading eventually to its self-oscillation.

Experimental tests of quantum phenomena involving massive macroscopic objects would provide novel insights into these fundamental questions. Making use of the unique environment provided by space, MAQRO aims at investigating this largely unexplored realm of macroscopic quantum physics. MAQRO has originally been proposed as a medium-sized fundamental-science space mission for the 2010 call of Cosmic Vision. MAQRO unites two experiments: DECIDE (DECoherence In Double-Slit Experiments) and CASE (Comparative Acceleration Sensing Experiment). The main scientific objective of MAQRO, which is addressed by the experiment DECIDE, is to test the predictions of quantum theory for quantum superpositions of macroscopic objects containing more than 108 atoms. Under these conditions, deviations due to various suggested alternative models to quantum theory would become visible. These models have been suggested to harmonize the paradoxical quantum phenomena both with the classical macroscopic world and with our notion of Minkowski space-time. The second scientific objective of MAQRO, which is addressed by the experiment CASE, is to demonstrate the performance of a novel type of inertial sensor based on optically trapped microspheres. CASE is a technology demonstrator that shows how the modular design of DECIDE allows to easily incorporate it with other missions that have compatible requirements in terms of spacecraft and orbit. CASE can, at the same time, serve as a test bench for the weak equivalence principle, i. e., the universality of free fall with test-masses differing in their mass by 7 orders of magnitude. © 2012 The Author(s).","Equivalence principle; ESA's cosmic vision; Fundamental physics; Macrorealism; Quantum mechanics; Quantum optomechanics; Space mission",

A drawback is that the effect of one photon tends to be tiny, and hence one of the pressing challenges is to substantially increase the interaction strength. A novel scenario is to introduce into the setup a quantum two-level system (qubit), which, besides strengthening the coupling, allows for rich physics via strongly enhanced nonlinearities. Here we present a design of cavity optomechanics in the microwave frequency regime involving a Josephson junction qubit. We demonstrate boosting of the radiation-pressure interaction by six orders of magnitude, allowing to approach the strong coupling regime. We observe nonlinear phenomena at single-photon energies, such as an enhanced damping attributed to the qubit.

Conventionally, these devices operate in megahertz frequency range where the acoustic wavelength is much longer than the optical wavelength and a long interaction length is required to attain significant coupling. With nanoscale transducers, acoustic waves with sub-optical wavelengths can now be excited to induce strong acousto-optic coupling in nanophotonic devices. Here we demonstrate microwave frequency surface acoustic wave transducers co-integrated with nanophotonic resonators on piezoelectric aluminum nitride substrates. Acousto-optic modulation of the resonance modes at above 10 GHz with the acoustic wavelength significantly below the optical wavelength is achieved. The phase and modal matching conditions in this scheme are investigated for efficient modulation.

In this review, we focus on the cavity optomechanical cooling, which exploits the cavity enhanced interaction between optical field and mechanical motion to reduce the thermal noise. Recent remarkable theoretical and experimental efforts in this field have taken a major step forward in preparing the motional quantum ground state of mesoscopic mechanical systems.

However, dynamical effects related to the vectorial nature of the optomechanical interaction remain to be investigated. Here we study a nanowire with subwavelength dimensions coupled strongly to a tightly focused beam of light, enabling an ultrasensitive readout of the nanoresonator dynamics. We determine experimentally the vectorial structure of the optomechanical interaction and demonstrate that a bidimensional dynamical backaction governs the nanowire dynamics. Moreover, the spatial topology of the optomechanical interaction is responsible for novel canonical signatures of strong coupling between mechanical modes, which leads to a topological instability that underlies the non-conservative nature of the optomechanical interaction.

In contrast to the Keplerian intuition that objects should be pushed downstream an incident photon flux, the concept of 'negative' optical forces has recently been described and has triggered many developments. Here, we report on the counterintuitive angular analogue of negative optical forces by demonstrating that circularly polarized Gaussian light beams give rise to torque with opposite sign to that of the incident optical angular momentum. Such a 'left-handed' mechanical effect is demonstrated by the use of an inhomogeneous and anisotropic transparent macroscopic medium. Practical difficulties associated with the direct observation of optically induced spinning of a macroscopic object are circumvented via the rotational Doppler effect.

The steady-state mean-field equation of the optical mode is identical to the one for a Kerr medium, and thus we expect it to have the same characteristic behavior with a lower, a middle, and an upper branch. However, the presence of position fluctuations of the mechanical resonator leads to a new feature: the upper branch will become unstable at sufficiently strong driving in certain parameter regimes. We identify the appropriate parameter regime for the upper branch to be stable, and we confirm, by numerical investigation of the quantum steady state, that the mechanical mode indeed acts as a Kerr nonlinearity for the optical mode in the low-temperature limit.

Here, we show that high-frequency stress resonant with the spin state splitting can also coherently control NV center spins. Because this mechanical drive is parity nonconserving, controlling spins with stress enables direct access to the magnetically forbidden | - 1〉 ↔ 1 + 1〉 spin transition. Using a bulk-mode mechanical microresonator fabricated from single-crystal diamond, we apply intense ac stress to the diamond substrate and observe mechanically driven Rabi oscillations between the | - 1〉 and | + 1〉 states of an NV center spin ensemble. Additionally, we measure the inhomogeneous spin dephasing time (T<inf>2</inf>*) of the spin ensemble within this {-1, + 1} subspace using a mechanical Ramsey sequence and compare it to the dephasing times measured with a magnetic Ramsey sequence for each of the three spin qubit combinations available within the NV center ground state.

Only the oscillator paradox addresses the question of mesoscopic local reality for a massive system. In that case, EPR's ""elements of reality"" are defined for the oscillator, and it is these elements of reality that are falsified (if quantum mechanics is complete). For this sort of paradox, we show that a thermal barrier exists, meaning that a threshold level of pulse-oscillator interaction is required for a given thermal occupation n0 of the oscillator. We find there is no equivalent thermal barrier for the entanglement of the pulse with the oscillator or for the EPR paradox that addresses the local reality of the optical system.

We focus specifically on situations where the optical dissipation is the dominant source of damping, in which case the optical field can be adiabatically eliminated, resulting in effective multimode interactions between the mechanical modes. In the case of linear coupling, the coherent contribution to the interaction can be exploited (e.g., in quantum state swapping protocols), while the incoherent part leads to significant modifications of cold damping or amplification from the single-mode situation. Quadratic coupling can result in a wealth of possible effective interactions including the analogs of second-harmonic generation and four-wave mixing in nonlinear optics, with specific forms depending sensitively on the sign of the coupling. The cavity-mediated mechanical interaction of two modes is investigated in two limiting cases: the resolved sideband and the Doppler regime.

A straightforward application to the cooling of the translational motion of other polarizable particles without sharply defined two-level transitions (such as molecules) fails as optical pumping transfers the particle into uncoupled states. An alternative operation in the far-off-resonant regime generates only very slow cooling due to the reduced field-particle coupling. We suggest one can overcome this by using a strongly driven ring cavity operated in the sideband cooling regime. The dynamics can be mapped onto the optomechanics setup with a movable mirror and allows one to take advantage of a collectively enhanced field-particle coupling by large photon numbers. A linearized analytical treatment confirmed by full numerical quantum simulations predicts fast cooling despite the off-resonant small single-particle-single-photon coupling. Even ground-state translational cooling (in the external potential) can be obtained by tuning the cavity field close to the Anti-stokes sideband for sufficiently high trapping frequency. Numerical simulations show quantum jumps of the particle between the lowest two trapping levels, which can be directly and continuously monitored via scattered light intensity detection. © 2010 The American Physical Society.",,"Analytical treatment; Anti-Stokes sidebands; Cavity cooling; Cavity field; Cavity photons; Cooling regimes; External potential; Level transition; Movable mirrors; Numerical simulation; Opto-mechanics; Optomechanical; Photon numbers; Polarizable particles; Quantum jumps; Quantum simulations; Ring cavities; Scattered light; Single-particle; Slow cooling; Strong-coupling regime; Translational motions; Trapping frequency; Trapping levels; Computer simulation; Optical pumping; Photons; Cooling"

Near the avoided crossings we find that the optical spring shows distinct features that arise from the interaction between cavity modes. Precisely at an avoided crossing, we show that the particular form of the optical spring provides a classical analogue of a quantum non-demolition measurement of the intracavity photon number.

These properties can provide strong observational constraints for the theoretical computation of nucleosynthesis at low metallicity. An important issue is the relative surface density of CH stars, which can provide valuable input to our understanding of the role of low- to intermediate-mass stars in early Galactic chemical evolution. Spectroscopic characterization provides an effective way of identifying CH stars. The present analysis aims at a quantitative assessment of the fraction of CH stars in a sample using a set of spectral classification criteria. The sample consists of 92 objects selected from a collection of candidate faint high-latitude carbon stars from the Hamburg/ESO survey. Medium-resolution (λ/δλ∼ 1300) spectra for these objects were obtained using the Optomechanics Research (OMR) spectrograph at the Vainu Bappu Observatory (VBO), Kavalur and the Himalaya Faint Object Spectrograph (HFOSC) at the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), Indian Astronomical Observatory, Hanle, during 2007-2009, spanning a wavelength range 3800-6800 Å. Spectral analysis shows 36 of the 92 objects to be potential CH stars; combined with our earlier studies this implies ∼37 per cent (of 243 objects) as the CH fraction. We present spectral descriptions of the newly identified CH star candidates. Estimated effective temperatures, 12C/13C isotopic ratios and their locations on the two-colour J-H versus H-K plot are used to support their identification. © 2009 The Authors.

The conventional explanation attributes the enhancement to the subwavelength confinement of the electromagnetic field near nanoantennas. Here, we introduce a new model that also accounts for the dynamical nature of the plasmon-molecule interaction. We thereby reveal an enhancement mechanism not considered before: dynamical backaction amplification of molecular vibrations. We first map the system onto the canonical Hamiltonian of cavity optomechanics, in which the molecular vibration and the plasmon are parametrically coupled. We express the vacuum optomechanical coupling rate for individual molecules in plasmonic â € hot-spotsâ € in terms of the vibrational mode's Raman activity and find it to be orders of magnitude larger than for microfabricated optomechanical systems. Remarkably, the frequency of commonly studied molecular vibrations can be comparable to or larger than the plasmon's decay rate. Together, these considerations predict that an excitation laser blue-detuned from the plasmon resonance can parametrically amplify the molecular vibration, leading to a nonlinear enhancement of Raman emission that is not predicted by the conventional theory. Our optomechanical approach recovers known results, provides a quantitative framework for the calculation of cross-sections, and enables the design of novel systems that leverage dynamical backaction to achieve additional, mode-selective enhancements. It also provides a quantum mechanical framework to analyse plasmon-vibrational interactions in terms of molecular quantum optomechanics. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"Article; electromagnetic field; excitation; microtechnology; molecular dynamics; molecular mechanics; nonlinear system; optomechanics; oscillation; phonon; plasmon enhanced Raman scattering; polarization; priority journal; quantum mechanics; Raman spectrometry; room temperature; vibration"

Optical delay is the most prominent feature of electromagnetically induced transparency, and in cavity optomechanics, the optical delay is limited by the mechanical dissipation rate of sideband-resolved mechanical modes. Here we demonstrate a cascaded optical transparency scheme by leveraging the parametric phonon-phonon coupling in a multimode optomechanical system, where a low damping mechanical mode in the unresolved-sideband regime is made to couple to an intermediate, high-frequency mechanical mode in the resolved-sideband regime of an optical cavity. Extended optical delay and higher transmission as well as optical advancing are demonstrated. These results provide a route to realize ultra-long optical delay, indicating a significant step towards integrated classical and quantum information storage devices. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"electromagnetic field; optical property; physics; Article; electromagnetic field; electromagnetically induced transparency; information storage; mechanical probe; nuclear physics; optics; phonon; quantum chemistry"

The mechanical resonator is capacitively coupled to the CPT, such that mechanical displacements of the resonator cause a shift in the CPT inductance and hence the cavity's resonant frequency. The amplification provided by the CPT is sufficient for the zero point motion of the mechanical resonator alone to cause a significant change in the cavity resonance. Conversely, a single photon in the cavity causes a shift in the mechanical resonator position on the order of its zero point motion. As a result, the cavity-Cooper pair transistor coupled to a mechanical resonator will be able to access a regime in which single photons can affect single phonons and vice versa. Realizing this ultra-strong coupling regime will facilitate the creation of non-classical states of the mechanical resonator, as well as the means to accurately characterize such states by measuring the cavity photon field. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.","cavity optomechanics; Cooper pair transistor; nanoelectromechanical systems",

By selecting only detection events that occur long after a photon pulse arrives at the cavity, the optomechanical interaction time can be increased, allowing a large momentum kick to be applied to the oscillator. We apply this to two optomechanical cavities set-up within a Mach-Zhender interferometer driven by a single photon source. The conditional state of the mechanical modes in such a system becomes an entangled cat state for detection times resulting in maximum mechanical amplitude in phase space. Further we study the dynamics induced by a second photon pulse injected into an already conditioned optomechanical cavity, a quarter of a mechanical period after the first photon has been detected.

We show that this effect is very significant in ultrathin bimetallic cantilevers, in which the laser beam that probes the picometer scale vibration largely modifies the resonant frequencies of the system. The light back-action effect is nonlinear, and some resonant frequencies can even be reduced to a half with laser power intensities of 2 mW. We demonstrate that this effect arises from the stress and strain generated by the laser heating. The experiments are explained by two-dimensional nonlinear elasticity theory and supported by finite element simulations. The found phenomenology is intimately connected to the old unsolved problem about the effect of surface stress on the resonance frequency of singly clamped beams. The results indicate that to achieve the ultimate detection limits with nanomechanical resonators one must consider the uncertainty due to the detection back-action. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","cantilevers; nanomechanical sensors; optomechanics; surface stress","Axial stress; Biological sensors; cantilevers; Clamped beams; Detection limits; Finite element simulations; Laser power; Nanomechanical resonators; Nanomechanical sensors; Nanomechanical systems; Nonlinear elasticity theory; Opto-mechanics; Resonance frequencies; Shedding light; Stress and strain; Surface stress; Ultra-thin; Unsolved problems; Biosensors; Chemical detection; Elasticity; Laser heating; Nanocantilevers; Sensors; Surface properties; Natural frequencies; biomaterial; gold; metal; nanomaterial; silicon derivative; silicon nitride; article; chemistry; elasticity; finite element analysis; methodology; nanotechnology; normal distribution; optics; reproducibility; scanning electron microscopy; statistical model; surface property; temperature; Biocompatible Materials; Elasticity; Finite Element Analysis; Gold; Metals; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Models, Statistical; Nanostructures; Nanotechnology; Normal Distribution; Optics and Photonics; Reproducibility of Results; Silicon Compounds; Surface Properties; Temperature"

In this work, the spectral response of the propulsion forces exerted on polystyrene microspheres near tapered microfibers is directly observed. The measurements are based on the control of the detuning between the tunable laser and internal resonances in each sphere with accuracy higher than the width of the resonances. The measured spectral shape of the propulsion forces correlates well with the whispering-gallery mode resonances in the microspheres. The existence of a stable radial trap for the microspheres propelled along the taper is demonstrated. The giant force peaks observed for 20-μm spheres are found to be in a good agreement with a model calculation demonstrating an efficient use of the light momentum for propelling the microspheres. The optical propulsion of polystyrene microspheres is studied in tapered microfiber couplers in both spectral and time domains simultaneously. By tuning the wavelength of the guided mode, it is shown that the spectral shape, position and magnitude of the observed propelling force peaks are explained by efficient light-momentum transfer to microspheres under resonance with their whispering-gallery modes.

The main reason is that this interaction is responsible for a wide variety of intriguing physical phenomena, ranging from the laser-induced cooling of a micromechanical resonator down to its ground state to the management of the speed of guided light pulses by exciting sound waves. A common feature of all these phenomena is the feasibility to tightly confine photons and phonons of similar wavelengths in a very small volume. Amongst the different structures that enable such confinement, optomechanical or phoxonic crystals, which are periodic structures displaying forbidden frequency band gaps for light and sound waves, have revealed themselves as the most appropriate candidates to host nanoscale structures where the light-sound interaction can be boosted. In this review, we describe the theoretical tools that allow the modeling of the interaction between photons and acoustic phonons in nanoscale structures, namely cavities and waveguides, with special emphasis in phoxonic crystal structures. First, we start by summarizing the different optomechanical or phoxonic crystal structures proposed so far and discuss their main advantages and limitations. Then, we describe the different mechanisms that make light interact with sound, and show how to treat them from a theoretical point of view. We then illustrate the different photon-phonon interaction processes with numerical simulations in realistic phoxonic cavities and waveguides. Finally, we introduce some possible applications which can take enormous benefit from the enhanced interaction between light and sound at the nanoscale. © 2014 Science Wise Publishing & De Gruyter 2014.","Brillouin scattering; cavity optomechanics; electrostriction; light-sound interaction; optomechanical crystals; phononic crystals; photonic crystals; radiation pressure","Acoustics; Brillouin scattering; Crystal structure; Electrostriction; Energy gap; Frequency bands; Ground state; Micromechanical resonators; Nanotechnology; Phonons; Photonic crystals; Photons; Waveguides; Cavity optomechanics; Optomechanical; Phononic Crystal; Radiation pressure; Sound interactions; Light"

[Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 253601 (2012)]. Here, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation describing mechanical limit cycles in the quantum regime that correctly reproduces the numerically observed nonclassical features. The derivation starts from the standard optomechanical master equation and is based on techniques borrowed from the laser theory due to Haake and Lewenstein. We compare our analytical model with numerical solutions of the master equation based on Monte Carlo simulations and find very good agreement over a wide and so far unexplored regime of system parameters. As one main conclusion, we predict negative Wigner functions to be observable even for surprisingly classical parameters, i.e., outside the single-photon strong-coupling regime, for strong cavity drive and rather large limit-cycle amplitudes. The approach taken here provides a natural starting point for further studies of quantum effects in optomechanics.","Nanophysics; Quantum physics","Monte Carlo methods; Quantum electronics; Master equations; Mechanical resonators; Nanophysics; Numerical solution; Opto-mechanical systems; Quantum physics; Strong-coupling regime; Wigner functions; Laser theory"

Typically, MNFs taper drawn from glass optical fibers or bulk glasses show excellent surface smoothness, high homogeneity in diameter and integrity, which bestows these tiny optical fibers with low waveguiding losses and outstanding mechanical properties. Benefitting from their wavelengthor sub-wavelength-scale transverse dimensions, waveguiding MNFs exhibit a number of interesting properties, including tight optical confinement, strong evanescent fields, evident surface field enhancement and large and abnormal waveguide dispersion, which makes them ideal nanowaveguides for coherently manipulating light, and connecting fiber optics with near-field optics, nonlinear optics, plasmonics, quantum optics and optomechanics on the wavelength- or sub-wavelength scale. Based on optical MNFs, a variety of technological applications, ranging from passive micro-couplers and resonators, to active devices such as lasers and optical sensors, have been reported in recent years. This review is intended to provide an up-to-date introduction to the fabrication, characterization and applications of optical MNFs, with emphasis on recent progress in our research group. Starting from a brief introduction of fabrication techniques for physical drawing glass MNFs in Section 2, we summarize MNF optics including waveguiding modes, evanescent coupling, and bending loss of MNFs in Section 3. In Section 4, starting from a ""MNF tree"" that summarizes the applications of MNFs into 5 categories (waveguide & near field optics, nonlinear optics, plasmonics, quantum &, atom optics, optomechanics), we go to details of typical technological applications of MNFs, including optical couplers, interferometers, gratings, resonators, lasers and sensors.

The limited movements of the accommodating apparatus that remain in the eye can be transferred to a wide range of accommodation that surpasses the natural performance of the young natural crystalline lens. This overperformance might be helpful in compensation for less effective optomechanics owing to lens design or ocular aging. Currently available lenses are being constructed from hard polymethyl methacrylate optics requiring a 6-mm incision for implantation. Other materials (acrylics, silicones, and hydrogels) that already exist will enable further development of the NuLens principles to produce thinner and foldable lenses for insertion through smaller incisions. Furthermore, by increasing the refractive index of the flexible material, the power range of the lens is significantly increased; therefore, less deformation of the flexible material is necessary for the same optical results. Our in vivo studies have confirmed that there is sufficient force and movement in the primate eye to operate lens prototypes that are built according to NuLens principles. These prototype implants were well tolerated in primate eyes and enabled them to perform delicate tasks that obligated an estimated accommodative range of +8 to -13 D from the dioptric power of the implant in the nonaccommodating state. The manufacturer, NuLens, is currently conducting intensive research into the mechanism of this unique method. As this mechanism is gradually revealed, it will become possible to establish more efficient methods to use the minute movements and forces of the human accommodating system to operate a functioning accommodative system that is also under complete brain control. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The geometry and emissivity of the optomechanics can affect the temperature reading. We show how the traditional optomechanical design of the IR temperature measuring systems produce inaccurate results when used in handheld mobile devices. When the mobile device is not thermally stable and the measured targets are significantly colder than the device, the measurement error can be several degrees. Our new optomechanical design was optimised for handheld mobile use, and its optics performance was modelled and verified by prototyping. The temperature measurement and sensor calibration is based on only two signals, namely the thermopile and thermistor voltages of the IR detector. This is a very attractive method in high-volume consumer products because no additional components are needed to improve the measurement repeatability. The attainable repeatability of the implemented IR temperature sensor on a correct transferred calibration curve was better than ±0.5 °C in an operational temperature range from +13 to +49 °C and target range from +10 to +90 °C. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A central goal of the field is achieving single-photon strong coupling, which would enable the creation of quantum superposition states of motion. Reaching this limit requires significant improvements in optomechanical coupling and cavity coherence. Here we introduce an optomechanical architecture consisting of a silicon nitride membrane coupled to a three-dimensional superconducting microwave cavity. Exploiting their large quality factors, we achieve an optomechanical cooperativity of 146,000 and perform sideband cooling of the kilohertz-frequency membrane motion to 34±5μK, the lowest mechanical mode temperature reported to date. The achieved cooling is limited only by classical noise of the signal generator, and should extend deep into the ground state with superconducting filters.

It is found that a triple coupling involving a photon, a phonon and an atom cannot be described only by the quasi-orbital angular momentum at frequency resonance, there also exists the phenomenon of parameter resonance, namely, when the system parameters are matched in some way, the evolution of the end mirror of the cavity is conditioned by the dressed states of the photon-atom subsystem. The quantum decoherence due to this conditional dynamics is studied in detail. In the quasi-classical limit of very large angular momentum, this system will behave like a standard cavity-QED system described by the Jaynes-Cummings (J-C) model when the angular momentum operators are transformed to bosonic operators of a single mode.

Fringe visibility requirements for space interferometry prescribe that the optical path length difference between the two arms must be equal and stable to less than 5 nm RMS to a bandwidth of 1 kHz. For a space mission, an ODL must also operate in a vacuum for years, survive temperature extremes, and survive the launch environment. As part of the interferometer technology program (ITP) at JPL, a prototype ODL was designed and built to meet typical space mission requirements. It has survived environmental testing at flight qualification levels, and control design studies indicate the 5 nm RMS pathlength stability requirements can be met. The design philosophy for this ODL was to crete as many design concepts as possible which would allow a priori attainment of requirements, in order to minimize analysis, testing, and reliance on workmanship. Many of these concepts proved to be synergistic, and many attacked more than one requirement. This paper reviews the science and flight qualification requirements for the ITP ODL and details design concepts used to meet these requirements.

Due to the strong van-der-Waals interaction between the atoms, the ensemble forms an effective two-level system, a Rydberg superatom, with a collectively enhanced atom-light coupling. Using this superatom imposed collective enhancement strong coupling between membrane and superatom is feasible for parameters within the range of current experiments. The quantum interface to couple the membrane and the superatom can be a pumped single mode cavity, or a laser field in free space, where the Rydberg superatom and the membrane are spatially separated. In addition to the coherent dynamics, we study in detail the impact of the typical dissipation processes, in particular the radiative decay as a source for incoherent superpositions of atomic excitations. We identify the conditions to suppress these incoherent dynamics and thereby a parameter regime for strong coupling. The Rydberg superatom in this hybrid system serves as a toolbox for the nanomechanical resonator allowing for a wide range of applications such as state transfer, sympathetic cooling and non-classical state preparation. As an illustration, we show that a thermally occupied membrane can be prepared in a non-classical state without the necessity of ground state cooling. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.","cavity optomechanics; non-classical state preparation; Rydberg physics","Hybrid systems; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Atomic excitations; Cavity optomechanics; Ground state cooling; Incoherent superposition; Nanomechanical resonators; Rydberg; State preparation; Sympathetic cooling; Atoms"

Nanomotors from biology often integrate a ratchet-like passive control and a power-stroke-like active control, and this synergic active-plus-passive control is critical to efficient utilization of energy. It remains a challenge to integrate the two differing types of control in rationally designed nanomotor systems. Recently a light-powered track-walking DNA nanomotor was developed from a bioinspired design principle that has the potential to integrate both controls. However, it is difficult to separate experimental signals for either control due to a tight coupling of both controls. Here we present a systematic study of the motor and new derivatives using different fluorescence labeling schemes and light operations. The experimental data suggest that the motor achieves the two controls autonomously through a mechanics-mediated symmetry breaking. This study presents an experimental validation for the bioinspired design principle of mechanical breaking of symmetry for synergic ratchet-plus-power stroke control. Augmented by mechanical and kinetic modeling, this experimental study provides mechanistic insights that may help advance molecular control in future nanotechnological systems. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","control; DNA; kinesin; myosin; nanomotor; optomechanics",

However, inventing these nanomotors remains difficult, a sharp contrast to the widespread success of simpler switch-like nanodevices, even though the latter already encompasses basic elements of the former such as engine-like bistate contraction/extension or leg-like controllable binding. This conspicuous gap reflects an impeding bottleneck for the nanomotor development, namely, lack of a modularized construction by which spatially and functionally separable ""engines"" and ""legs"" are flexibly assembled into a self-directed motor. Indeed, all track-walking nanomotors reported to date combine the engine and leg functions in the same molecular part, which largely underpins the device-motor gap. Here we propose a general design principle allowing the modularized nanomotor construction from disentangled engine-like and leg-like motifs, and provide an experimental proof of concept by implementing a bipedal DNA nanomotor up to a best working regime of this versatile design principle. The motor uses a light-powered contraction-extension switch to drive a coordinated hand-over-hand directional walking on a DNA track. Systematic fluorescence experiments confirm the motors directional motion and suggest that the motor possesses two directional biases, one for rear leg dissociation and one for forward leg binding. This study opens a viable route to develop track-walking nanomotors from numerous molecular switches and binding motifs available from nanodevice research and biology. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","DNA; modular design; molecular machine; nanomotor; optomechanics","Modular designs; Molecular machines; Molecular switches; Nanomotors; Opto-mechanics; Self-directed; DNA; DNA; nanomaterial; DNA; Nanostructures"

Finite element computed optical surface deformations are fit to several polynomial types including Zernikes, aspheric, and XY polynomials. Higher frequency deformations are interpolated to a user-defined uniform grid size using linear, quadratic, or cubic finite element shape functions to create interferogram files. Three-dimensional shape function interpolation is used to create OPD maps due to thermo-optic effects (dn/dT), which are subsequently fit to polynomials and/or interferogram files. Similar techniques are also used for stress birefringence effects. Adaptive optics uses influence functions to minimize surface error before or after pointing and focus correction.

It is usually assumed that both the optical momentum and the radiation-pressure force are naturally aligned with the propagation direction of light, given by its wavevector. Here we report the direct observation of an extraordinary optical momentum and force directed perpendicular to the wavevector, and proportional to the optical spin (degree of circular polarization). Such an optical force was recently predicted for evanescent waves and other structured fields. It can be associated with the 'spin-momentum' part of the Poynting vector, introduced by Belinfante in field theory 75 years ago. We measure this unusual transverse momentum using a femtonewton-resolution nano-cantilever immersed in an evanescent optical field above the total internal reflecting glass surface. Furthermore, the measured transverse force exhibits another polarization-dependent contribution determined by the imaginary part of the complex Poynting vector.

Consequently, for the thermodynamics of photons, while we have a concept of temperature for energy conservation, there is no equivalent chemical potential for particle number conservation. However, the notion of a chemical potential is crucial in understanding a wide variety of single- and many-body effects, from transport in conductors and semiconductors to phase transitions in electronic and atomic systems. Here we show how a direct modification of the system-bath coupling via parametric oscillation creates an effective chemical potential for photons even in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we show that the photonic system equilibrates to the temperature of the bath, with a tunable chemical potential that is set by the frequency of the parametric coupler. Specific implementations, using circuit-QED or optomechanics, are feasible using current technologies, and we show a detailed example demonstrating the emergence of Mott insulator-superfluid transition in a lattice of nonlinear oscillators.

The performance of stressed silicon nitride nanomembranes as mechanical resonators notoriously depends on how their frame is clamped to the sample mount, which in practice usually necessitates delicate, and difficult-to-reproduce mounting solutions. Here, we demonstrate that a phononic bandgap shield integrated in the membrane's silicon frame eliminates this dependence, by suppressing dissipation through phonon tunneling. We dry-etch the membrane's frame so that it assumes the form of a cm-sized bridge featuring a 1-dimensional periodic pattern, whose phononic density of states is tailored to exhibit one, or several, full band gaps around the membrane's high-Q modes in the MHz-range. We quantify the effectiveness of this phononic bandgap shield by optical interferometry measuring both the suppressed transmission of vibrations, as well as the influence of frame clamping conditions on the membrane modes. We find suppressions up to 40 dB and, for three different realized phononic structures, consistently observe significant suppression of the dependence of the membrane's modes on sample clampingif the mode's frequency lies in the bandgap. As a result, we achieve membrane mode quality factors of 5×106 with samples that are tightly bolted to the 8 K-cold finger of a cryostat. Q×f -products of 6×1012 Hz at 300 K and 14×1012 Hz at 8 K are observed, satisfying one of the main requirements for optical cooling of mechanical vibrations to their quantum ground-state. © 2014 Optical Society of America.",,"Energy gap; Phonons; Resonance; Silicon nitride; Vibrations (mechanical); Clamping conditions; Density of state; Dielectric membranes; Mechanical resonators; Optical interferometry; Periodic pattern; Quantum optomechanics; Stressed silicon; Membranes"

This article reports on dispersive radiation coupling of nanomechanical oscillators to the evanescent near-field of toroid optical microresonators. The optomechanical coupling coefficient which reaches values >200 MHz/nm, corresponding to a vacuum optomechanical coupling rate >4 kHz, is characterized in detail and good agreement between experimental, analytical and finite element simulation based values is found. It is shown that both the mode-structure and -patterns of nanomechanical oscillators can be characterized relying solely on Brownian motion. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the radiation pressure interaction can cause self-sustained coherent nanomechanical oscillations at nano-Watt power levels as well as cooling of the nanomechanical oscillator. Finally, the feasibility of coupling nanomechanical motion to two optical modes where the optical mode spacing exactly equals the mechanical resonance frequency is demonstrated for the first time. As shown here, this Raman-type scheme allows both amplification and cooling. © 2011 Académie des sciences.","Cavity optomechanics; Dynamical backaction; Microresonator; Nanomechanical oscillator; Precision measurement; Radiation pressure cooling and amplication",

By employing a Bloch-Redfield-Wangsness approach, we show that the influence of dephasing-type interactions, i.e., elastic collisions with a background bath of phonons, critically depends on the nature of the bath modes. In particular, for long-range phonons corresponding to a common bath, the dynamics of the 'bright state' (the collective superposition of molecular vibrations coupling to the cavity mode) is effectively decoupled from other system eigenStates. For the case of independent baths (or short-range phonons), incoherent energy transfer occurs between the bright state and the uncoupled dark States. However, these processes are suppressed when the Rabi splitting is larger than the frequency range of the bath modes, as achieved in a recent experiment (Shalabney et al 2015 Nat. Commun. 6 5981). In both cases, the dynamics can thus be described through a single collective oscillator coupled to a photonic mode, making this system an ideal candidate to explore cavity optomechanics at room temperature. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.","organic molecules; polaritons; quantum optics; strong coupling; vibrational modes","Electric excitation; Energy transfer; Molecular vibrations; Molecules; Phonons; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Cavity optomechanics; Electromagnetic modes; Organic molecules; Polaritons; Quantum mechanical formalism; Strong coupling; Vibrational excitation; Vibrational modes; Vibrations (mechanical)"

However, at visible wavelengths, graphene absorbs weakly and reflects even less, thereby is inadequate to generate large optical forces needed in optomechanics. Here, we numerically show that a single-layer graphene sheet is sufficient to produce strong optical forces under terahertz or infrared illumination. For a system as simple as graphene suspended atop a uniform substrate, high reflectivity from the substrate is crucial in creating a standing-wave pattern, leading to a strong optical force on graphene. This force is readily tunable in amplitude and direction by adjusting the suspension height. In particular, repellent optical forces can levitate graphene to a series of stable equilibrium heights above the substrate. One of the key parameters to maximize the optical force is the excitation frequency: peak forces are found near the scattering frequency of free carriers in graphene.

The fundamental process at the heart of this interdisciplinary endeavor is the enhancement of radiation pressure within a high-finesse optical cavity. Isolating this weak interaction, i.e. the momentum transfer of photons onto the cavity boundaries, requires the development of mechanical resonators that simultaneously exhibit high reflectivity (requiring low absorption and scatter loss) and low mechanical dissipation. In a Fabry-Pérot implementation, this is realized by fabricating suspended micrometer-scale mechanical resonators directly from high-reflectivity multilayers. Thus, the properties of the mirror material - particularly the loss angle and optical absorption - drive the ultimate performance of the devices. Interestingly, similar requirements are found in a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from gravitational wave interferometers to stabilized lasers for optical atomic clocks. This overlap leads to an intimate link between advances in the seemingly disparate areas of macroscopic interferometry (e.g. precision measurement and spectroscopy) and micro- and nanoscale optomechanical systems. In this manuscript, I will outline the fascinating implications of cavity optomechanics and present proof-of-concept experiments including MHz-frequency resonators aimed at the demonstration of quantum states of mechanical systems, as well as low-frequency (<1 kHz) devices for the observation of quantum radiation pressure noise. Additionally, I will discuss off-shoot technologies developed in the course of this work, such as a numerical solver for the determination of support-mediated losses in mechanical resonators, as well as a new strategy for the realization of ultra-high-stability optical reference cavities based on transferred crystalline multilayers. © 2012 SPIE.","Cavity optomechanics; Compound semiconductors; Distributed Bragg reflectors; Epitaxy; Fabry-Pérot cavities; Micromechanics; Optical resonators","Broad spectrum; Cavity boundaries; Compound semiconductors; Gravitational wave interferometers; High reflectivity; Interdisciplinary endeavor; Loss angle; Low noise; Mechanical dissipation; Mechanical resonators; Mechanical systems; Micrometer-scale; Mirror materials; Modern optics; Nano scale; Numerical solvers; Optical atomic clocks; Optical cavities; Opto-mechanics; Optomechanical systems; Precision measurement; Proof of concept; Quantum radiation; Quantum state; Radiation pressure; Scatter loss; Stabilized lasers; Weak interactions; Crystalline materials; Distributed Bragg reflectors; Epitaxial growth; Light; Micromanipulators; Micromechanics; Mirrors; Multilayers; Optical resonators; Pressure; Optical multilayers"

Due to inherent confounding factors in vivo, in vitro measurements have been undertaken using a robotic lens stretcher to examine these mechanisms as well as the efficacy of lens refilling - a proposed treatment for presbyopia. Dynamic forces, anterior and posterior curvatures, and lens thickness are all correlated for young natural and refilled porcine lenses. Comparisons are made to lenses refilled with a homogeneous polymer system. The amplitude of accommodation of the young porcine lens is very small such that it may be a suitable model for presbyopia.

Firstly, we study classical dynamics in a membrane-in-the-middle optomechanical system in which a partially reflecting and flexible membrane is suspended inside an optical cavity. We show that the membrane can present self-sustained oscillations with limit cycles in the shape of sawtooth-edged ellipses and exhibit dynamical multistability. Then, we study the dynamics of the quantum fluctuations around the classical orbits. By using the logarithmic negativity, we calculate the evolution of the quantum entanglement between the optical cavity mode and the membrane during the mechanical oscillation.

However, most progress during the past years have focused on the linearization of the optomechanical interaction, which ignored the intrinsic nonlinear nature of the optomechanical coupling. Exploring nonlinear optomechanical interaction is of growing interest in both classical and quantum mechanisms, and nonlinear optomechanical interaction has emerged as an important new frontier in cavity optomechanics.

This unique property can enable a remarkable phenomenon: conversion of optical fields via optomechanical coupling between vastly different wavelengths. Here we expand an earlier experimental study [Science 338, 1609 (2012)] on classical wavelength conversion of coherent optical fields by coupling two optical modes to a mechanical breathing mode in a silica resonator. Heterodyne detection of the converted optical fields shows that the wavelength conversion process is coherent and bidirectional. The conversion efficiency obtained features a distinct saturation behavior that arises from optomechanical impedance matching. A measurement of the coherent mechanical excitation involved in the wave-length conversion process also provides additional insight on the underlying optomechanical interactions. © 2014 by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, their rotational symmetry and low radiation loss impede energy exchange between WGMs and the surrounding. As a result, free-space coupling of light into and from WGMRs is very challenging. In previous schemes, resonators are intentionally deformed to break circular symmetry to enable free-space coupling of carefully aligned focused light, which comes with bulky size and alignment issues that hinder the realization of compact WGMR applications. Here, we report a new class of nanocouplers based on cavity enhanced Rayleigh scattering from nano-scatterer(s) on resonator surface, and demonstrate whispering gallery microlaser by free-space optical pumping of an Ytterbium doped silica microtoroid via the scatterers.

A derivation from first principles leads to a multi-mode optomechanical Hamiltonian where multiple cavity modes are coupled by the thickness variation of the membrane. For membrane thicknesses of the order of 1μm, the frequency of this dilational mode is in the GHz range. This can be matched to the free spectral range of the optical cavity, such that the mechanical oscillator will resonantly couple cavity modes at different frequencies. Furthermore, such a large mechanical frequency also means that the quantum ground state of motion can be reached with conventional refrigeration techniques. Estimation of the coupling strength with realistic parameters suggests that optomechanical effects can be observable with this dilational mode. It is shown how this system can be used as a quantum limited optical amplifier. The dilational motion can also lead to quantum correlations between cavity modes at different frequencies, which is quantified with an experimentally accessible two-mode squeezing spectrum.

Methods: In five formaldehyde fixed specimens frontolateral and retrosigmoid approaches were prepared on both sides and five target positions of the endoscopes tip were defined. A rigid 4 mm endoscope, which offers in one plane a viewing range of approximately -10° to +120° by turning a proximal knob coupled to fine distal optomechanics was compared to 0°, 45°, and 70° rigid endoscopes. The visualizable neuroanatomical structures were assessed for each position, endoscope angle, and plane of view as well as the over-all visibility of neuroanatomical structures and the time factor. Results: 1905 recorded images of 1800 different views were analyzed. The EC offers a variable angle of view in one plane without need to change the endoscope position. This feature is well suited for inspection of functionally delicate areas at the skull base. The maximum number of visible structures for each position was only seen with the EC. Endoscopic exploration was significantly less time consuming with the EC than with the other endoscopes. Conclusion: The EC provided superior usability and visualization potential compared to standard rigid endoscopes with fixed angulation. It combines the ergonomic and safety advantage of not having to insert endoscopes with different angles with the opportunity to ""scan"" the surgical field with a variable angle of 0°-120° within one plane of view. © 2009.","Endochamaeleon; Endoscope-assisted skull base surgery; Neuroendoscopy; Variable-view rigid endoscope","article; endoscope; endoscopic surgery; human; image analysis; imaging system; neuroanatomy; neuroendoscopy; neurosurgery; priority journal; skull base; surgical instrument; Brain; Humans; Neuroendoscopes; Neuroendoscopy; Neurosurgery"

The current focus of these optomechanical effects has been on cavity optomechanics systems in which co-localized optical and mechanical modes interact strongly to enable wave mixing between photons and phonons, and backaction cooling of mechanical modes. Alternatively, extended mechanical modes can also induce strong non-local effects on propagating optical fields or multiple localized optical modes at distances. Here, we demonstrate a multicavity optomechanical device in which torsional optomechanical motion can shuttle photons between two photonic crystal nanocavities. The resonance frequencies of the two cavities, one on each side of this 'photon see-saw', are modulated antisymmetrically by the device's rotation. Pumping photons into one cavity excites optomechanical self-oscillation, which strongly modulates the inter-cavity coupling and shuttles photons to the other empty cavity during every oscillation cycle in a well-regulated fashion. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We show that our scheme has many advantages over ponderomotive squeezing; in particular, it is far more effective in the good cavity limit commonly used in experiments. Furthermore, the squeezing generated in our approach can be directly used to enhance the intrinsic measurement sensitivity of the optomechanical cavity; one does not have to feed the squeezed light into a separate measurement device.

Examples include a setup with a movable membrane between two end-mirrors and ""optomechanical crystal"" devices that support localized optical and mechanical modes in a photonic crystal type structure. We discuss how mechanical driving of such structures results in coherent photon transfer between optical modes, and how the physics of Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg oscillations arises in this context. Another area where multiple modes are involved are hybrid systems. There, we review the recent proposal of a single atom whose mechanical motion is coupled to a membrane via the light field.

Alternatively, quantum objects can be made to emit and exchange real photons, providing either unidirectional coupling in cascaded geometries, or bidirectional coupling that is particularly strong when both objects are placed within a common electromagnetic resonator. However, in such an open system, the capacity of a coupling channel to convey quantum information or generate entanglement may be compromised by photon loss.

This requires couplings larger than the mechanical frequency and cavity-damping rate, and is difficult to achieve experimentally. Here we show how to exponentially enhance the single-photon optomechanical coupling strength using only additional linear resources. Our method is based on using a large-amplitude, strongly detuned mechanical parametric drive to amplify mechanical zero-point fluctuations and hence enhance the radiation pressure interaction. It has the further benefit of allowing time-dependent control, enabling pulsed schemes. For a two-cavity optomechanical set-up, we show that our scheme generates photon blockade for experimentally accessible parameters, and even makes the production of photonic states with negative Wigner functions possible.

Combining these circuit elements, it is possible to simulate a quadratic optomechanical coupling whose coupling strength is determined by the coupling capacitance and the tunable bias flux through the SQUIDs. Estimates using realistic parameters suggest that an improvement in the coupling strength could be realized, to five orders of magnitude from what has been observed in membrane-in-the-middle cavity optomechanical systems.

Here we introduce an optomechanical system combining strong nonlinear optomechanical coupling, low mass, and large optical mode spacing. This nanoscale “paddle nanocavity” supports mechanical resonances with hundreds of femtograms of mass that couple nonlinearly to optical modes with a quadratic optomechanical coupling coefficient g(2) < 2π × 400 MHz/nm2, and a single-photon to twophonon optomechanical coupling rate of Δω<inf>0</inf> > 2π × 16 Hz. This coupling relies on strong phonon–photon interactions in a structure whose optical mode spectrum is highly nondegenerate. Nonlinear optomechanical readout of thermally driven motion in these devices should be observable for T>50 mK, and measurement of phonon shot noise is achievable. This shows that strong nonlinear effects can be realized without relying on coupling between nearly degenerate optical modes, thus avoiding the parasitic linear coupling present in twomode systems. © 2015 Optical Society of America.","Integrated optics devices; Nanophotonics and photonic crystals; Nonlinear; Optomechanics; Photonic crystals",

In this review, we survey recent progress in the understanding and experimental observation of optomechanical and quantum-fluctuation forces. Although both of these effects arise from exchange of electromagnetic momentum, their dramatically different origins, involving either real or virtual photons, lead to different physical manifestations and design principles. Specifically, we describe recent predictions and measurements of attractive and repulsive optomechanical forces, based on the bonding and antibonding interactions of evanescent waves, as well as predictions of modified and even repulsive Casimir forces between nanostructured bodies.

Tripartite non-locality is observed in the atom-light-mirror system, as demonstrated by the violation of the Mermin-Klyshko (MK) inequality. It has been shown [C. Genes, et al., PRA 77, 050307 (R) (2008)] that tripartite entanglement is optimized when the cavity is resonant with the anti-Stokes sideband of the driving laser and the atomic frequency matches the Stokes one. However, we show that this is not the case for the nonlocality. The MK function achieves minima when the atoms are resonant with both the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands, and unexpectedly, we find violation of the MK inequality only in a parameter region where entanglement is far from being maximum. A negative relation exists between nonlocality and entanglement with consideration of the possibility of bipartite nonlocality in the violation of the MK inequality. We also study the non-classicality of the mirror by post-selected measurements, e.g. Geiger-like detection, on the cavity and/or the atoms.

We find that this two-mode model can be reduced to an effective single-mode model if we drive the pump mode strongly and detect the signal from the weak probe mode. We show that the optimal force sensitivity at zero frequency (dc) beats the standard quantum limit via squeezing and is limited by mechanical thermal noise and optical losses. We also find that the bandwidth is proportional to the cavity damping in the resolved sideband regime. Finally, the squeezing spectrum of the output signal is calculated and it shows that almost perfect squeezing at dc is possible by using a high-quality factor and high-frequency mechanical oscillator.

Taking advantage of these new phase regimes, one can obtain group delay, dispersion and nonlinearity properties greatly enhanced by almost one order of magnitude, compared to the traditionally constructed EIT-like devices, all of which breaks the fundamental limitation (e.g. delay-bandwidth product) intrinsic to atomic EIT and EIT-like effects.

We then demonstrate excellent thermalization of a 63-MHz mechanical mode of a toroidal resonator down to the cryostats base temperature of 1.65 K, thereby proving the viability of the cryogenic refrigeration via heat conduction through static low-pressure exchange gas.

A magnetic or electric field induces a spatially varying stress across the sensor, which then induces a force on mechanical eigenmodes of the system. The force on each oscillator can then be determined from an overlap integral between magnetostrictive stress and the corresponding eigenmode, with the optomechanical coupling strength determining the ultimate resolution with which this force can be detected. Furthermore, an optomechanical magnetic field sensor is compared to other magnetic field sensors in terms of sensitivity and potential for miniaturization. It is shown that an optomechanical sensor can potentially outperform state-of-the-art magnetometers of similar size, in particular other sensors based on a magnetostrictive mechanism. © The Author(s) 2012.","Cavity optomechanics; Integrated microcavity; Magnetic field sensors; Magnetostriction","Coupling strengths; Eigen modes; Field sensors; Magnetic field sensors; Magnetostrictive mechanism; Opto-mechanical sensors; Opto-mechanics; Optomechanical; Overlap integrals; Varying stress; Chemical bonds; Electric fields; Magnetic sensors; Magnetostriction; Magnetostrictive devices; Molecular orbitals; Stresses; Wave functions; Magnetometers"

Special software tools and techniques have been developed to determine the degradation in image quality as measured by the modulation transfer function (MTF) and to identify regions of the telescope to be redesigned in order to minimize the LoS jitter response. A general purpose finite element program is used to find the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the telescope. Each of the optical surfaces for each mode shape is then decomposed into average rigid body motion and elastic deformation. Automated calculation of the LoS equations based on the optical prescription of the telescope provides the LoS response due to expected random loads. The percent contribution of each mode shape to the total LoS jitter is reported that helps pinpoint regions of the telescope structure to redesign. The LoS error due to the random input is then decomposed into drift and jitter components based on a specified sensor integration time. The random jitter is converted to a jitter MTF response function which may be used to modify the MTF function of the nominal optical system yielding the resulting optical system MTF in the operational random environment. © 2011 SPIE.","FEA; Integrated analysis; Line-of-sight jitter; MTF; Optomechanics; Random vibration","Integrated analysis; Line-of-sight jitter; MTF; Opto-mechanics; Random vibration; Computer aided software engineering; Forecasting; Image quality; Integration; Optical systems; Optical telescopes; Optical transfer function; Random errors; Telescopes; Jitter"

At the optomechanical interface, manufacturing tolerances affect the shape and position of the surface in a lens system. Even very small variations will cause extra aberrations which degrade the optical performance of a lens system. The traditional approach to the optomechanical tolerance design is a top-down process. The optical designers typically designate the critical to quality parameters, such as tolerances of tilts, decenters, and locations of optical elements. A significant drawback of this top-down process is that the tolerances determined by optical designers do not take the real manufacturing and assembly process into consideration. As a result, some tolerances are too tight for the manufacturing, and the yield rate of the production is difficult to improve. The objective of this study is to develop a surface based optomechanical tolerance model that calculates the variation of the critical to quality parameters for a lens system. The distribution of these parameters can be treated as inputs to the optical design. Therefore, the optical performance will be predictable than the top-down approach, and the manufacturability of the optical system can be improved.","Assembly; Lens system; Optomechanics; Tolerance","Mathematical models; Optical design; Optical systems; Parameter estimation; Quality assurance; Lens system; Optomechanical interface; Optomechanical tolerance models; Optomechanics; Optical instrument lenses"

For a number of recently proposed applications in which multiple optical and mechanical modes interact, an outstanding challenge is to develop multimode architectures that allow flexibility in optical and mechanical subsystem designs while maintaining the strong interactions that have been demonstrated in single-mode systems. To that end, we demonstrate slot-mode optomechanical crystals, devices in which photonic and phononic crystal nanobeams separated by a narrow slot are coupled via optomechanical interactions. These nanobeam pairs are patterned to confine a mechanical breathing mode at the center of one beam and a low-loss optical mode in the slot between the beams. This architecture affords great design flexibility toward multimode optomechanics, as well as substantial optomechanical coupling rates. We show this by producing slot-mode devices in stoichiometric Si3N4, with optical modes in the 980 nm band coupled to mechanical modes at 3.4 GHz, 1.8 GHz, and 400 MHz. We exploit the Si3N4 tensile stress to achieve slot widths down to 24 nm, which leads to enhanced optomechanical coupling, sufficient for the observation of optomechanical self-oscillations at all studied frequencies. We then develop multimode optomechanical systems with triple-beam geometries, in which two optical modes couple to a single mechanical mode, and two mechanical modes couple to a single optical mode.

Here, we demonstrate sideband-resolved coupling between multiple photonic nanocavities and propagating surface acoustic waves up to 12 GHz. Coherent and strong photon-phonon interaction is manifested with electro-optomechanically induced transparency, absorption, and amplification, and phase-coherent interaction in multiple cavities.

A stunning manifestation of optomechanical phenomena is in exploiting the mechanical effects of light to couple the optical degree of freedom with mechanical degree of freedom. In this report, we investigate the controlled bistable dynamics of such hybrid optomechanical system composed of cigar-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) trapped inside high-finesse optical cavity with one moving-end mirror and is driven by a single mode optical field. The numerical results provide evidence for controlled optical bistability in optomechanics using transverse optical field which directly interacts with atoms causing the coupling of transverse field with momentum side modes, exited by intra-cavity field. This technique of transverse field coupling is also used to control bistable dynamics of both moving-end mirror and BEC. The report provides an understanding of temporal dynamics of moving-end mirror and BEC with respect to transverse field. Moreover, dependence of effective potential of the system on transverse field has also been discussed. To observe this phenomena in laboratory, we have suggested a certain set of experimental parameters. These findings provide a platform to investigate the tunable behavior of novel phenomenon like electromagnetically induced transparency and entanglement in hybrid systems.",,

Steady state solutions at the mean-field level reveal that there is a critical strength of the light-membrane coupling above which there is a symmetry breaking bifurcation where the membrane spontaneously acquires a displacement either to the left or the right. This bifurcation bears many of the signatures of a second order phase transition and we compare and contrast it with that found in the Dicke model. In particular, by studying limiting cases and deriving dynamical critical exponents using the fidelity susceptibility method, we argue that the two models share very similar critical behaviour. For example, the obtained critical exponents indicate that they fall within the same universality class. Away from the critical regime we identify, however, some discrepancies between the two models.

At the beginning of 2006, it was realized that the telescope's image quality suffered from optical aberrations, chiefly a focus gradient across the focal plane, but also accompanied by astigmatism and higher order aberrations. In the previous conference in this series, a paper was presented describing the optical system engineering investigation which had been conducted to diagnose the problem. This investigation exonerated the primary mirror as the cause, as well as the science instruments, and was isolated to the interface between the telescope and a major optical sub-system, the spherical aberration corrector (SAC). This is a complex sub-system of four aspheric mirrors which corrects the spherical aberration of the 11-m primary mirror. In the last two years, a solution to this problem was developed which involved removing the SAC from the telescope, installing a modification of the SAC/telescope interface, re-aligning and testing the four SAC mirrors and re-installation on the telescope. This paper describes the plan, discusses the details and shows progress to date and the current status. © 2010 SPIE.","Aspheric mirrors; Astigmatism; Image quality; Optical aberrations; Optomechanics; SAC; SALT; Southern African Large Telescope; Spherical aberration corrector","Aspheric mirrors; Astigmatism; Optical aberration; Opto-mechanics; SAC; Southern African Large Telescopes; Spherical aberration correctors; Aspherics; Geometrical optics; Image quality; Installation; Instruments; Mirrors; Optical systems; Optical telescopes; Optical testing; Spheres; Aberrations"

However with a given input signal it is possible to define areas of the chip which act as a fovea, returning high spatial resolution. The surrounding peripheral vision acts to return lower spatial resolution but much higher temporal resolution. Our chip is therefore able to achieve full spatial resolution via scanning of the fovea across the visual field. This operation is analogous to the functioning of the human eye. In the human eye however, the limitations of biology enforce a fixed fovea, while the optomechanics are highly efficient. In our structure, we acknowledge the limitations of physical optomechanics but use the advantages of silicon processing to achieve dynamic foveation.

The elementary excitations in superfluid helium have been probed with great success using techniques such as neutron and light scattering. However, measurements of phonon excitations have so far been limited to average thermodynamic properties or the driven response far out of thermal equilibrium. Here, we use cavity optomechanics to probe the thermodynamics of phonon excitations in real time. Furthermore, strong light-matter interactions allow both laser cooling and amplification. This represents a new tool to observe and control superfluid excitations that may provide insight into phonon-phonon interactions, quantized vortices and two-dimensional phenomena such as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.

EIT, a result of Fano interference among different atomic transition levels, has acquired a significant importance in many areas of physics, such as atomic physics and quantum optics. However, controllability of such multi-dimensional systems has remained a crucial issue. In this report, we investigate the controllability of EIT and Fano resonances in hybrid optomechanical system composed of cigar-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), trapped inside high-finesse Fabry-Pérot cavity with one vibrational mirror, driven by a single mode optical field and a transverse pump field. The transverse field is used to control the phenomenon of EIT. It is detected that the strength of transverse field is not only efficiently amplifying or attenuating out-going optical mode but also providing an opportunity to enhance the strength of Fano-interactions which leads to the amplification of EIT-window. To observe these phenomena in laboratory, we suggest a certain set of experimental parameters. The results provide a route for tunable manipulation of optical phenomena, like EIT, which could be a significant step in quantum engineering.",,"experimental model"

The fiber form or nacre can, simplify manufacturing and offer new functional properties unknown yet for other forms of biomimetic materials. Here we demonstrate that nacre-like fibres can be produced by shear-induced self-assembly of nanoplatelets. The synergy between two structural motifs - nanoscale brick-and-mortar stacking of platelets and microscale twisting of the fibres - gives rise to high stretchability (&gt;400%) and gravimetric toughness (640 J g-1).

The net cooling of solids through spontaneous Raman scattering and the laser refrigeration of indirect band gap semiconductors both remain unsolved challenges. Here, we show analytically that photonic density of states (DoS) engineering can address the two fundamental requirements for achieving spontaneous Raman cooling: suppressing the dominance of Stokes (heating) transitions and the enhancement of anti-Stokes (cooling) efficiency beyond the natural optical absorption of the material. We develop a general model for the DoS modification to spontaneous Raman scattering probabilities, and elucidate the necessary and minimum condition required for achieving net Raman cooling. With a suitably engineered DoS, we establish the enticing possibility of the refrigeration of intrinsic silicon by annihilating phonons from all its Ramanactive modes simultaneously, through a single telecom wavelength pump. This result points to a highly flexible approach for the laser cooling of any transparent semiconductor, including indirect band gap semiconductors, far away from significant optical absorption, band-edge states, excitons, or atomic resonances. © 2015 Optical Society of America.","Laser cooling; Photonic crystals; Scattering, Raman",

Here, we study the optical response of a cantilever-like, silica, microsphere pendulum, evanescently coupled to a fiber taper. In a whispering gallery mode resonator, the cavity mode and motion of the pendulum result in both dispersive and dissipative optomechanical interactions. This unique mechanism leads to an experimentally observable, asymmetric response function of the transduction spectrum, which can be explained using coupled-mode theory. The optomechanical transduction and its relationship to the external coupling gap are investigated, and we show that the experimental behavior is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.

The model considers two mechanical modes with distinct frequencies coupled optomechanically to the same cavity mode. The dissipative cavity field mediates the interaction between the mechanical modes but also leads to decoherence of the mechanical oscillators. Depending on the ratio between effective interaction strength and dissipation rate, which can be chosen via the pump detuning, the interaction assumes a quantum mechanical or classical character. The distinction between the two regimes is made by the ability of the mediated interaction to correlate the two mechanical modes non-classically. For any cavity decay, there is a regime where the two mechanical modes interact in a non-classical way, which leads us to conclude that optomechanical systems can serve as a model to experimentally study the transition of effective interactions mediated by classical or quantum-mechanical fields. © 2014 by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This approach allows for testing for possible deviations from quantum theory as our test objects approach macroscopic dimensions.

The DCT AOS maintains collimation and controls the figure of the mirror to provide seeing-limited images across the focal plane. To minimize observing overhead, rapid settling times are achieved using a combination of feed-forward and low-bandwidth feedback control using a wavefront sensing system. In 2011, we mounted a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor at the prime focus of M1, the Prime Focus Test Assembly (PFTA), to test the AOS with the wavefront sensor, and the feedback loop. The incoming wavefront is decomposed using Zernike polynomials, and the mirror figure is corrected with a set of bending modes. Components of the system that we tested and tuned included the Zernike to Bending Mode transformations. We also started open-loop feed-forward coefficients determination.

The sensor is an optical payload for an eletro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) dual band camera that combines visible and IR imaging capabilities in a compact and lightweight package. It adopts a Ritchey-Chrétien telescope for the common front end optics with several relay optics that divide and deliver EO and IR bands to a charge-coupleddevice (CCD) and an IR detector, respectively. The EO/IR camera for dual bands is mounted on a two-axis gimbal that provides stabilized imaging and precision pointing in both the along and cross-track directions. We first investigate the mechanical deformations, displacements and stress of the EO/IR camera through finite element analysis (FEA) for five cases: three gravitational effects and two thermal conditions. For investigating gravitational effects, one gravitational acceleration (1 g) is given along each of the +x, +y and +z directions. The two thermal conditions are the overall temperature change to 30°C from 20°C and the temperature gradient across the primary mirror pupil from -5°C to +5°C. Optical performance, represented by the modulation transfer function (MTF), is then predicted by integrating the FEA results into optics design/analysis software. This analysis shows the IR channel can sustain imaging performance as good as designed, i.e., MTF 38% at 13 line-pairs-per-mm (lpm), with refocus capability. Similarly, the EO channel can keep the designed performance (MTF 73% at 27.3 lpm) except in the case of the overall temperature change, in which the EO channel experiences slight performance degradation (MTF 16% drop) for 20°C overall temperate change.","Airborne sensor; EO; IR; MTF; Optomechanics","Aerial vehicle; Air-borne sensors; Airborne cameras; Displacements and stress; Dual Band; EO; Front end; Gravitational accelerations; Imaging performance; IR bands; IR detector; Mechanical deformation; MTF; Optical payloads; Optical performance; Optics design; Opto-mechanics; Performance degradation; Primary mirrors; Relay optics; Temperature changes; Temperature gradient; Thermal condition; Two-axis; Z-directions; Cameras; Electrooptical devices; Finite element method; Gravitational effects; Infrared imaging; Optics; Remote sensing; Stresses; Optical transfer function"

It has already been suggested that seeing limited imaging cameras for telescopes whose diameters are larger than 20m are considered virtually impossible for a reasonable cost. We show here that, using existing technology and at a moderate price, one can build a Smart Fast Camera, a device that placed on aberrated Field of View, including those of slow focal ratios, is able to provide imaging at an equivalent focal ratio as low as F/1, with a size that is identical to the large focal ratio focal plane size. The design allows for easy correction of aberrations over the Field of View. It has low weight and size with respect to any focal reducer or prime focus station of the same performance. It can be applied to existing 8m-class telescopes to provide a wide field fast focal plane or to achieve seeing-limited imaging on Extremely Large Telescopes. As it offers inherently fast read-out in a massive parallel mode, the SFC can be used as a pupil or focal plane camera for pupil-plane or Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing for 30-100m class telescopes.","Extremely Large Telescope; Lenslet array; Seeing limited; Smart Focal Plane; Wavefront sensing; Wide-field camera","Astronomy; Charge coupled devices; Control equipment; Detectors; Spectrographs; Telescopes; Wavefronts; Extremely large telescope; Lenslet array; Seeing limited; Smart focal plane; Wavefront sensing; Wide-field camera; Cameras"

Diamond is also rich in optically active defects, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) and silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers, which behave as atom-like systems in the solid state. Predictions and observations of coherent coupling of the NV electronic spin to phonons via lattice strain have motivated the development of diamond nanomechanical devices aimed at the realization of hybrid quantum systems in which phonons provide an interface with diamond spins. In this work, we demonstrate diamond optomechanical crystals (OMCs), a device platform to enable such applications, wherein the co-localization of ∼200 THz photons and few to 10 GHz phonons in a quasi-periodic diamond nanostructure leads to coupling of an optical cavity field to a mechanical mode via radiation pressure. In contrast to other material systems, diamond OMCs operating in the resolved-sideband regime possess large intracavity photon capacities (>105) and sufficient optomechanical coupling rates to reach a cooperativity of ∼20 at room temperature, allowing for the observation of optomechanically induced transparency and the realization of large-amplitude optomechanical self-oscillations. © 2016 Optical Society of America.","Diamond machining; Optical devices; Optical resonators; Optomechanics",

This begs for the development of a broader theory that contains both fields. Here, we derive the dynamics of optomechanical cavities from that of Brillouin-active waveguides. This explicit transition elucidates the link between phenomena such as Brillouin amplification and electromagnetically induced transparency. It proves that effects familiar from cavity optomechanics all have traveling-wave partners, but not vice versa. We reveal a close connection between two parameters of central importance in these fields: the Brillouin gain coefficient and the zero-point optomechanical coupling rate. This enables comparisons between systems as diverse as ultracold atom clouds, plasmonic Raman cavities, and nanoscale silicon waveguides. In addition, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that unobserved effects, such as photon-assisted amplification of traveling phonons, are now accessible in existing systems.

Their performance depends critically on the exact distribution of optical energy, confined and shaped by the nanoscale device geometry. Near-field optical probes can image this distribution, but the physical probe necessarily perturbs the near field, which is particularly problematic for sensitive high-quality-factor resonances. We present a new approach to mapping nanophotonic modes that uses a controllably small and local optomechanical perturbation introduced by a focused lithium ion beam. An ion beam (radius of 50...nm) induces a picometre-scale deformation of the resonator surface, which we detect through shifts in the optical resonance wavelengths. We map five modes of a silicon microdisk resonator (Q - 20,000) with high spatial and spectral resolution. Our technique also enables in situ observation of ion implantation damage and relaxation dynamics in a silicon lattice. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

IGRINS employs a silicon immersion grating as the primary disperser, and volume-phase holographic gratings cross-disperse the H and K bands onto Teledyne Hawaii-2RG arrays. The use of an immersion grating facilitates a compact cryostat while providing simultaneous wavelength coverage from 1.45 - 2.5 μm. There are no cryogenic mechanisms in IGRINS and its high-throughput design maximizes sensitivity. IGRINS on the 2.7 meter Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory is nearly as sensitive as CRIRES at the 8 meter Very Large Telescope. However, IGRINS at R 45,000 has more than 30 times the spectral grasp of CRIRES∗ in a single exposure. Here we summarize the performance of IGRINS from the first 300 nights of science since commissioning in summer 2014. IGRINS observers have targeted solar system objects like Pluto and Ceres, comets, nearby young stars, star forming regions like Taurus and Ophiuchus, the interstellar medium, photo dissociation regions, the Galactic Center, planetary nebulae, galaxy cores and super novae. The rich near-infrared spectra of these objects motivate unique science cases, and provide information on instrument performance. There are more than ten submitted IGRINS papers and dozens more in preparation. With IGRINS on a 2.7m telescope we realize signal-to-noise ratios greater than 100 for K=10.3 magnitude sources in one hour of exposure time. Although IGRINS is Cassegrain mounted, instrument flexure is sub-pixel thanks to the compact design. Detector characteristics and stability have been tested regularly, allowing us to adjust the instrument operation and improve science quality. A wide variety of science programs motivate new tools for analyzing high-resolution spectra including multiplexed spectral extraction, atmospheric model fitting, rotation and radial velocity, unique line identification, and circumstellar disk modeling. Here we discuss details of instrument performance, summarize early science results, and show the characteristics of IGRINS as a versatile near-infrared spectrograph and forerunner of future silicon immersion grating spectrographs like iSHELL 2 and GMTNIRS. 3 © 2016 SPIE.","Broad-band coverage; Giant Magellan Telescope; H2RG array; High resolution; Infrared optics; Near-infrared; Optomechanics; Silicon immersion grating; Spectrograph; Young stellar objects","Diffraction gratings; Galaxies; Near infrared spectroscopy; Observatories; Optical telescopes; Signal to noise ratio; Silicon; Spectrographs; Stars; Telescopes; Broad bands; Giant magellan telescopes; H2RG array; High resolution; Immersion grating; Infrared optics; Near Infrared; Opto-mechanics; Young stellar objects; Infrared devices"

Static and dynamic characterizations are experimentally verified. An actuation range of 30 μm is well attainable; resonances are captured with an evaluated quality factor of 40 (measured in air) and a bandwidth of 5 Hz for the primary vertical resonance of 200 Hz. A settling time of 200 ms in transient response indicates the damping properties of such actuation scheme. This actuation principle suppresses the need for electrodes on the mobile, non-conductive component and is particularly interesting for moving transparent elements.

Usually, such protocols involve the action of an external, classical field (the battery) of infinite energy, that controls the energy levels of a small quantum system (the calorific fluid). Here we suggest a realistic device to reversibly extract work in a battery of finite energy: a hybrid optomechanical system. Such devices consist of an optically active two-level quantum system interacting strongly with a nano-mechanical oscillator that provides and stores mechanical work, playing the role of the battery. We identify protocols where the battery exchanges large, measurable amounts of work with the quantum emitter without getting entangled with it. When the quantum emitter is coupled to a thermal bath, we show that thermodynamic reversibility is attainable with state-of-the-art devices, paving the road towards the realization of a full cycle of information-to-energy conversion at the single bit level. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.","optomechanics; quantum optics; quantum thermodynamics","Electric batteries; Oscillistors; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Thermodynamics; Battery exchanges; Mechanical oscillators; Opto-mechanical systems; Opto-mechanics; Quantum thermodynamics; Small quantum systems; Specific protocol; State-of-the-art devices; Quantum theory"

When the coupling between the mirrors and the corresponding cavity modes is weak, the two driven cavity fields can respectively behave as the squeezed-vacuum reservoir for the two movable mirrors by utilizing the effect of completely destructive interference of quantum noise. Thus the mechanical modes are prepared in a two-mode squeezed vacuum state. Moreover, when the coupling between the two mirrors and the cavities modes is strong, the entanglement between the two movable mirrors decreases because photonic excitation can preclude the completely destructive interference of quantum noise, but the movable mirrors are still entangled. © 2015, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","double dissipative optomechanics; efficient transfer of quantum correlations; EPR mechanical entanglement","Mirrors; Oscillistors; Quantum noise; Destructive interference; Mechanical oscillators; Movable mirrors; Opto-mechanics; Quantum correlations; Squeezed vacuum; Two-mode squeezed vacuum state; Two-mode squeezed vacuums; Quantum entanglement"

Usually, test data is only available for shear configuration at room temperature and fast pull rate. On the other hand, the slowly induced stress at extreme temperature is for many optical systems the worse-case scenario. Since one of the most referenced epoxy for optical assembly is the 3M™ Scotch-Weld™ Epoxy Adhesive EC-2216 B/A Gray, better understanding its behavior can benefit a broad range of applications. The objective of this paper is two-fold. First, review data for critical parameters such as Young's modulus and coefficient of thermal expansion. Secondly, derive failure criteria from correlation between a thermal stress experiment and a finite element model. Instead of pulling out a standard tensile specimen, it is proposed to test thin bondline geometry to replicate an optical device usage. Four test plates are assembled at the Institut National d'Optique (INO) in Quebec City, Canada with bondlines of 50 μm and 133 μm. To detect the failure of the epoxy, the low level vibration signature of a cantilever Invar plate is monitored as temperature changes.

In the infinite slice number limit this self-consistent approach allows to calculate light forces within a medium directly from the Maxwell stress tensor for any dielectric with prescribed refractive index distribution. For the generic example of a thick slab in counterpropagating fields the effective force and internal strain distribution strongly depend on the object's thickness and the injected field amplitudes. The corresponding trapping dynamics may even change from high-field-seeking to low-field-seeking behaviour while internal forces lead to pressure gradients and thus imply stretching or compression of an elastic object. Our results bear important consequences for a wide scope of applications, ranging from cavity optomechanics with membranes, size selective optical trapping and stretching of biological objects, light-induced pressure gradients in gases, to implementing light control in microfluidic devices.

It has already been suggested that seeing limited imaging cameras for telescopes whose diameters are larger than 20m are considered virtually impossible for a reasonable cost. It has also been suggested that using existing technology and at a moderate price, one can build a Smart Fast Camera, a device that placed on aberrated Field of View, including those of slow focal ratios, is able to provide imaging at an equivalent focal ratio as low as F/1, with a size that is identical to the large focal ratio focal plane size. The design allows for easy correction of aberrations over the Field of View. It has low weight and size with respect to any focal reducer or prime focus station of the same performance. It can be applied to existing 8m-class telescopes to provide a wide field fast focal plane or to achieve seeing-limited imaging on Extremely Large Telescopes. As it offers inherently fast read-out in a massive parallel mode, the SFC can be used as a pupil or focal plane camera for pupil-plane or Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing for 30-100m class telescopes. Basing upon Smart Fast Camera concept, we present a study turned to explain the pliability of this instrument for different existing telescopes.","Extremely Large Telescope; Lenslet array; Seeing limited; Smart Focal Plane; Wavefront sensing; Wide-field camera","Aberrations; Cameras; Charge coupled devices; Optical sensors; Optical telescopes; Wavefronts; Extremely Large Telescope; Lenslet array; Smart Focal Plane; Wavefront sensing; Wide-field camera; Imaging systems"

Such devices offer appealing alternatives to distributed Bragg reflectors and filters for various applications, such as optical wavelength and polarization filters, reflectors, semiconductor lasers, photodetectors, bio-sensors and non-linear optical components. Suspended PCS also have natural applications in the field of optomechanics, where the mechanical modes of a suspended slab interact via radiation pressure with the optical field of a high-finesse cavity. The reflectivity and transmission properties of a defect-free suspended PCS around normal incidence can be used to couple out-of-plane mechanical modes to an optical field by integrating it in a free-space cavity. Here we demonstrate the successful implementation of a PCS reflector on a high-tensile stress Si3N4 nanomembrane. We illustrate the physical process underlying the high reflectivity by measuring the photonic-crystal band diagram. Moreover, we introduce a clear theoretical description of the membrane scattering properties in the presence of optical losses. By embedding the PCS inside a high-finesse cavity, we fully characterize its optical properties. The spectrally, angular- and polarization-resolved measurements demonstrate the wide tunability of the membrane's reflectivity, from nearly 0 to 99.9470±0.0025%, and show that material absorption is not the main source of optical loss. Moreover, the cavity storage time demonstrated in this work exceeds the mechanical period of low-order mechanical drum modes. This so-called resolved-sideband condition is a prerequisite to achieve quantum control of the mechanical resonator with light. © The Author(s) 2017.","Fano resonance; high-reflectivity membrane; low-loss optical reflector; nanomembrane resonator; photonic-crystal slab; quantum optomechanics","DBR lasers; Fabry-Perot interferometers; Light scattering; Nanostructures; Optical properties; Polarization; Reflection; Resonance; Resonators; Semiconductor devices; Fano resonances; High reflectivity; Low-loss; Nanomembranes; Photonic crystal slab; Quantum optomechanics; Photonic crystals"

Here we point out that, among all implementations of gauge fields, the optomechanical setting allows for the most natural extension where the gauge field becomes dynamical. The mechanical oscillation phases determine the effective artificial magnetic field for the photons, and once these phases are allowed to evolve, they respond to the flow of photons in the structure. We discuss a simple three-site model where we identify four different regimes of the gauge-field dynamics. Furthermore, we extend the discussion to a two-dimensional lattice.

However, realizing cavity optomechanical devices from high-quality diamond chips has been an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate single-crystal diamond cavity optomechanical devices that can enable photon-phonon spin coupling. Cavity optomechanical coupling to 2 GHz frequency (fm) mechanical resonances is observed. In room-temperature ambient conditions, these resonances have a record combination of low dissipation (mechanical quality factor, Qm &gt; 9000) and high frequency, with Qm · fm ~ 1.9 × 1013, which is sufficient for room-temperature single-phonon coherence.

The devices’ potential for optomechanical control of diamond electron spins is demonstrated through radiation pressure excitation of mechanical self-oscillations whose 31 pm amplitude is predicted to provide 0.6 MHz coupling rates to diamond nitrogen vacancy center ground-state transitions (6 Hz/phonon) and ~105 stronger coupling rates to excited-state transitions. © 2016 Optical Society of America.",,

In these systems, phonons are coherently annihilated or created in exchange for photons. Similar phenomena have recently been observed through phonon-cavity coupling - energy exchange between the modes of a single system mediated by intrinsic material nonlinearity. This has so far been demonstrated primarily for bulk crystalline, high-quality-factor (Q &gt; 105) mechanical systems operated at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we propose graphene as an ideal candidate for the study of such nonlinear mechanics. The large elastic modulus of this material and capability for spatial symmetry breaking via electrostatic forces is expected to generate a wealth of nonlinear phenomena, including tunable intermodal coupling. We have fabricated circular graphene membranes and report strong phonon-cavity effects at room temperature, despite the modest Q factor (∼100) of this system. We observe both amplification into parametric instability (mechanical lasing) and the cooling of Brownian motion in the fundamental mode through excitation of cavity sidebands. Furthermore, we characterize the quenching of these parametric effects at large vibrational amplitudes, offering a window on the all-mechanical analogue of cavity optomechanics, where the observation of such effects has proven elusive. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Despite the large frequency difference between optical photons and magnons, coherent conversion can be achieved through a three-particle interaction between one magnon and two photons whose frequency difference is resonant with the magnon frequency, as in optomechanics with two photons and a phonon. The large spin density of a transparent ferromagnetic insulator (such as the ferrite yttrium iron garnet) in an optical cavity provides an intrinsic photon-magnon coupling strength that we calculate to exceed reported optomechanical couplings. A large cavity photon number and properly selected cavity detuning produce a predicted effective coupling strength sufficient for observing electromagnetically induced transparency and the Purcell effect, and even to reach the ultrastrong coupling regime. © 2016 American Physical Society.",,

We point out that homodyne detectors, which are commonly employed to detect quantum squeezing, are blind to squeezing spectra in which the correlation between amplitude and phase fluctuations is complex. We find theoretically that such complex squeezing is a component of ponderomotive squeezing of light through cavity optomechanics. We propose a detection scheme called synodyne detection, which reveals complex squeezing and allows the accounting of measurement backaction. Even with the optomechanical system subject to continuous measurement, such detection allows the measurement of one component of an external force with sensitivity only limited by the mechanical oscillator's thermal occupation. © 2016 American Physical Society.",,"Atomic physics; Physics; Amplitude and phase fluctuations; Cavity optomechanics; Continuous measurements; Detection scheme; Homodyne detector; Mechanical oscillators; Opto-mechanical systems; Standard quantum limits; Oscillistors"

Robustly implementing this platform is challenging, however, as it requires integrating optically smooth surfaces separated by λ/10. Here we describe an exceptionally high-cooperativity, single-chip optonanomechanical transducer based on a high-stress Si3N4 nanobeam monolithically integrated into the evanescent near field of SiO2 microdisk cavity. Employing a vertical integration technique based on planarized sacrificial layers, we realize beam-disk gaps as little as 25 nm while maintaining mechanical Qf>1012 Hz and intrinsic optical Q∼107. The combination of low loss, small gap, and parallel-plane geometry results in radio-frequency flexural modes with vacuum optomechanical coupling rates of 100 kHz, single-photon cooperativities in excess of unity, and large zero-point frequency (displacement) noise amplitudes of 10 kHz (fm)/√Hz. In conjunction with the high power-handling capacity of SiO2 and low extraneous substrate noise, the transducer performs particularly well as a sensor, with recent deployment in a 4-K cryostat realizing a displacement imprecision 40 dB below that at the standard quantum limit (SQL) and an imprecision-backaction product <5 [Wilson et al., Nature (London) 524, 325 (2015)]. In this report, we provide a comprehensive description of device design, fabrication, and characterization, with an emphasis on extending Heisenberg-limited readout to room temperature. Towards this end, we describe a room-temperature experiment in which a displacement imprecision 32 dB below that at the SQL and an imprecision-backaction product <60 is achieved.

Quantum noise is becoming a major limiting factor to such a task in future technology, especially in optomechanics for temperature, stochastic gravitational wave, and decoherence measurements. Motivated by this concern, here we prove a measurement-independent quantum limit to the accuracy of estimating the spectrum parameters of a classical stochastic process coupled to a quantum dynamical system. We demonstrate our results by analyzing the data from a continuous-optical-phase-estimation experiment and showing that the experimental performance with homodyne detection is close to the quantum limit.

The weightlessness of light has been identified very early as a key advantage for micro-actuator application, giving rise to optical free-space MEMS devices. In parallel to these developments, the past 20 years saw the emergence of a less pursued approach relying on guided optical wave, where, pushed by the similarities in fabrication process, researchers explored the possibilities offered by merging integrated optics and MEMS technology. The interest of using guided waves is well known (absence of diffraction, tight light confinement, small size, compatibility with fiber optics) but it was less clear how they could be harnessed with MEMS technology. Actually, it is possible to use MEMS actuators for modifying waveguide properties (length, direction, index of refraction) or for coupling light between waveguide, enabling many new devices for optical telecommunication, astronomy or sensing.

Interestingly, both exciton and acoustic phonon wave functions are strongly spatially localized within 5 nm, possibly mediated by the copolymer backbone, opening future opportunities to engineer dephasing and optical bandwidth for applications in quantum photonics and cavity optomechanics. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","acoustic phonon localization; carbon nanotubes; dephasing; excitons; isotope effects","Carbon nanotubes; Copolymers; Electromagnetic wave emission; Excitons; Isotopes; Luminescence; Wave functions; Yarn; Acoustic phonons; Atomic concentration; Carbon nanotubes displays; Cavity optomechanics; Dephasing; Exciton-phonon interactions; Isotope effect; Polyfluorene copolymer; Phonons"

Specifically, we consider a dielectric nanosphere rotating uniformly in a ring-shaped optical potential inside a Fabry-Perot resonator. The motion of the particle is probed by a weak angular lattice created by introducing two additional degenerate Laguerre-Gaussian cavity modes carrying equal and opposite orbital angular momenta. We demonstrate that the rotation frequency of the nanoparticle is imprinted on the probe optical mode, via the Doppler shift, and thus may be sensed experimentally using homodyne detection. We show analytically that the effect of the optical probe on the particle rotation vanishes in the regime of linear response, resulting in an accurate frequency measurement. We also numerically characterize the degradation of the measurement accuracy when the system is driven in the nonlinear regime.

This allows one to explore the mutual interaction and introduces new means to manipulate and control both light and mechanical motion. Such optomechanical systems have recently been implemented in nanoelectromechanical systems involving a nanomechanical beam coupled to a superconducting microwave resonator. Here, we propose optomechanical systems that involve multiple, coupled microwave resonators. In contrast to similar systems in the optical realm, the coupling frequency governing photon exchange between microwave modes is naturally comparable to typical mechanical frequencies. For instance this enables new ways to manipulate the microwave field, such as mechanically driving coherent photon dynamics between different modes. In particular we investigate two setups where the electromagnetic field is coupled either linearly or quadratically to the displacement of a nanomechanical beam.

Salt-water microdroplets can be used in such experiments while standing on a superhydrophobic surface that preserves their spherical geometry. Here, we report how the photothermal effect enables continuous tuning or locking of the whispering gallery mode (WGM) spectrum and size of salt-water microdroplets on a superhydrophobic surface. Local heating by an infrared laser focused at the center of a microdroplet causes it to depart from its equilibrium size, shifting the WGM spectrum. This photothermal tuning effect is fully reversible and can be used to tune the microdroplet radius with a precision reaching 1-Å. We combine this effect with fluorescence excitation spectroscopy using a fixed wavelength laser to measure Q-factors of up to ∼105. Conversely, focusing the heating laser to the microdroplet rim reveals absorption resonances, leading to a hysteretic behavior when cycling the laser power. We show that this behavior can be used to lock the size of a microdroplet and make it exhibit optical bistability. WGM resonances of locked microdroplets are probed using a tunable laser, showing a spectral locking precision reaching <0.01-nm over tens of minutes. These results indicate that the wavelength stability and positioning challenges inherent to liquid microdroplets in air can be overcome, providing an easily tunable and lockable alternative to solid optical microcavities and making them potential candidates for studies in cavity optomechanics. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Absorption resonance; Fluorescence excitation spectroscopy; Microdroplet; Optical bistability; Q-factor; Self-stability; Superhydrophobic surface; Whispering gallery mode","Absorption resonances; Fluorescence excitation spectroscopy; Micro droplets; Q-factors; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Whispering gallery modes; Absorption; Fluorescence; Heating; Hydrophobicity; Hysteresis; Infrared spectroscopy; Laser excitation; Lasers; Liquids; Microcavities; Q factor measurement; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Resonance; Surface properties; Tuning; Absorption spectroscopy"

For this reason great care is taken in design and construction to ensure optical rigidity and stability. However, some residual flexure is unavoidable, particularly for a system like the one being built at the JPL for the Cassegrain focus of the Palomar 200 inch, which will experience changing gravity loads as the telescope points and guides. Such flexure has direct impact when it occurs in the non-common-path segments of the wavefront-sensor and science beams. the diffraction- limited image size in K-band at the 5 m telescope is 30 microns. To maintain non-common-path flexure errors at a small fraction of this scale would require costly, gravity- compensated optomechanics. A more practical approach is to use precise measurements of the flexure in a periodic recalibration of the wavefront sensor offsets. As an alternative to mapping flexure over a grid of sky pointing positions, we have investigated a low-bandwidth metrology scheme in which we sense tilts and translations of optical components in the various light paths using visible laser signals.

The cavity is driven by a weak laser field while the QD is driven by another weak laser field. Due to the quantum destructive interference arisen from different transition channels induced by simultaneously driving the QD-cavity system in terms of the two different lasers, two-photon absorption for the cavity field can be effectively eliminated by performing an optimal quantum interference condition. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the QD-cavity system can be unbalancedly prepared in two single-polariton states with different eigenenergies. If the frequency of the NMR is tuned to be resonant with transition between two single-polariton states, it is found that a fast ground-state cooling for the NMR can also be achieved, even when the QD-cavity system is originally in the moderate-coupling regime.

This sensor, which allows for the continuous, broadband detection of feeble forces, is a hybrid dual-cavity system composed of a mesoscopic mechanical resonator optically coupled to an ensemble of ultracold atoms. In contrast to the stringent constraints on dissipation typically associated with purely optical schemes of CQNC, the dissipation rate of the mechanical resonator only needs to be matched to the decoherence rate of the atomic ensemble - a condition that is experimentally achievable even for the technologically relevant regime of low-frequency mechanical resonators with large quality factors.

Since this effect is too challenging to observe directly in the membrane-in-the-middle arrangement of quantum optomechanics, we analyze an analogical high-order nonlinear effect and propose to simulate it all-optically. Specifically, we exploit hybrid quantum optics based on single photon states and homodyne detection to conditionally construct a simulator for noise-driven nonclassical effects. We show that this simulation can confirm the presence of squeezing caused by nonlinear coupling pumped by a noisy light.

For this reason, the observation of such effects on larger scale systems is currently one of the most attractive goals in quantum science. Many experimental protocols have been proposed for both the creation and observation of quantum states on macroscopic scales, in particular, in the field of optomechanics. The majority of these proposals, however, rely on performing measurements, making them probabilistic. In this work we develop a completely deterministic method of macroscopic quantum state creation. We study the prototypical optomechanical Membrane In The Middle model and show that by controlling the membrane's opacity, and through careful choice of the optical cavity initial state, we can deterministically create and grow the spatial extent of the membrane's position into a large cat state. It is found that by using a Bose-Einstein condensate as a membrane high fidelity cat states with spatial separations of up to ∼ 300 nm can be achieved.",,

The derived expressions are used to analyze spectral properties of the resonator-particle system as functions of the particle's position, the size of the resonators, and the characteristics of WGMs. The obtained results are shown to agree well with available experimental data. It is also demonstrated that the particle-induced spectral effects can be significantly enhanced by careful selection of the resonator's size, refractive index, and other experimental parameters.

It is shown that feedback on the Y quadrature by itself can already squeeze the thermal motion of the resonator, but the maximum achievable squeezing level is limited by the imprecision noise. By combining the feedback and parametric pumping a record of 15.1 dB of classical noise squeezing is demonstrated. This not only largely exceeds the 3 dB limit for regular squeezing, but is also deeper than ever can be achieved with feedback cooling. The detector-resonator interaction is analyzed within the semi-classical framework and it is shown that using this feedback-stabilized parametric pumping technique true quantum-squeezed states can be prepared when the resonator starts off close to its ground state, and that the ultimate amount of squeezing depends on the minimum detuning that can be achieved. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.","cooling; feedback; nanomechanics; on-chip optics; optomechanics; squeezing","Cooling; Electromechanical devices; Ground state; Nanomechanics; Quantum theory; Resonators; Classical noise; Electromechanical resonators; Electromechanical systems; Feedback cooling; On chips; Opto-mechanics; Parametric pumping; squeezing; Feedback"

This is the case for the low cost drop-in approach in which the lenses are dropped into cavities cut into a barrel and clamped with threaded rings. The walls of a cavity are generally used to constrain the lateral and axial position of the lens within the cavity. In general, the drop-in approach is low cost but imposes fundamental limitations especially on the optical performances. On the other hand, active alignment methods provide a high level of centering accuracy but increase the cost of the optical assembly. This paper first presents a review of the most common lens mounting techniques used to secure and center lenses in optical systems. Advantages and disadvantages of each mounting technique are discussed in terms of precision and cost. Then, the different contributors which affect the centering of a lens when using the drop-in approach, such as the threaded ring, friction, and manufacturing errors, are detailed. Finally, a patent pending lens mounting technique developed at INO that alleviates the drawbacks of the drop-in and the active alignment approaches is introduced. This innovative auto-centering method requires a very low assembly time, does not need tight manufacturing tolerances and offers a very high level of centering accuracy, usually less than 5 μm.

Among the latter, optical properties, and more specifically radiative absorption, is sensitive to external forces due to the clear dependence between structure and excitation energy. Here we develop theoretical and computational tools aimed to guide molecular design of new or modified chromophores with a mechano-responsive excitation energy. In particular, we describe a methodology for determining the optimal external force (i.e. with lower possible magnitude) modifying the excitation energy of a molecular system. This optimal external force may serve as a guide to conveniently modify chemically the system in order to make feasible the exertion of such forces. Moreover, as force pairs are the easiest and more frequent kind of external forces acting over a molecular system, a protocol to determine the more efficient force pair modulating the excitation energy is proposed. Finally, these methods are tested with a chromophore, the semibullvalene molecule, finding the more efficient way to reduce its excitation energy with the application of simple external forces. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Absorption tuning; Excitation energy; Mechanochemistry; Optomechanics",

Instead of implementing boundary conditions on the field, we introduce an internal degree of freedom and its dynamics to describe the mirror's reflectivity. Depending on parameter values, the internal degrees of freedom of the mirror in this model capture a range of its optical activities, from those exhibiting broadband reflective properties to those reflecting only in a narrow band. After establishing the model we show how appropriate parameter choices lead to other well-known optomechanical models, including those of Barton and Calogeracos, Calogeracos and Barton, Ann. Phys. (NY)10.1006/aphy. 1995.1022 238, 268 (1995), Law, and Golestanian and Kardar. As a simple illustrative application we derive classical radiation pressure cooling from this model. We then connect our microphysics model to the common descriptions of a moving mirror coupled to radiation pressure (e.g., with Nx coupling, where N is the photon number and x is the mirror displacement), making explicit the underlying assumptions made in these phenomenological models. Our model is also applicable to the lesser explored case of small N, which existing models based on sideband approximations [Kimble, Phys. Rev. DPRVDAQ1550-799810.1103/PhysRevD. 65.022002 65, 022002 (2001)] have not addressed. Interestingly, we also find that slow-moving mirrors in our model can be described by the ubiquitous Brownian motion model of quantum open systems. The scope of applications of this model ranges from a full quantum-mechanical treatment of radiation pressure cooling and quantum entanglement between macroscopic mirrors to the back reaction of Hawking radiation on black-hole evaporation in a moving mirror analog. © 2013 American Physical Society.",,"Brownian motion model; Internal degrees of freedom; Kinematics and dynamics; Massless scalar fields; Phenomenological models; Quantum optomechanics; Quantum-mechanical treatments; Reflective properties; Pressure; Mirrors"

The spectra are numerically calculated for different initial states, which show that a single peak in the spectrum splits because of the presence of the optomechanical coupling and the increase of the number of phonon. In addition, the peak position in the cavity field spectra changes due to the Kerr nonlinearity, while the cavity detuning is modified.

The ARGO-M optical system consists of 40 cm receiving telescope, 10 cm transmitting telescope, and detecting optics. For the development of ARGO-M optical system, the structural analysis was performed with regard to the optics and optomechanics design and the optical components. To ensure the optical performance, the quality was tested at the level of parts using the laser interferometer and ultra-high-precision measuring instruments. The assembly and alignment of ARGO-M optical system were conducted at an auto-collimation facility. As the transmission and reception are separated in the ARGO-M optical system, the pointing alignment between the transmitting telescope and receiving telescope is critical for precise target pointing. Thus, the alignment using the ground target and the radiant point observation of transmitting laser beam was carried out, and the lines of sight for the two telescopes were aligned within the required pointing precision. This paper describes the design, structural analysis, manufacture and assembly of parts, and entire process related with the alignment for the ARGO-M optical system. © The Korean Space Science Society.","ARGO-M; Optical system; Optomechanics; Satellite laser tracking",

The optomechanical tolerance analysis is usually performed by the optomechanical engineer using his personal knowledge of the manufacturing precision capability. Worst case or root sum square (RSS) tolerance calculation methods are frequently used for their simplicity. In most situations, the chance to encounter the worst case error is statistically almost impossible. On the other hand, RSS method is generally not an accurate representation of the reality since it assumes centered normal distributions. Moreover, the RSS method is not suitable for multidimensional tolerance analysis that combines translational and rotational variations. An optomechanical tolerance analysis method based on Monte Carlo simulation has been developed at INO to reduce overdesign caused by pessimist manufacturing and assembly error predictions. Manufacturing data errors have been compiled and computed to be used as input for the optomechanical Monte Carlo tolerance model. This is resulting in a more realistic prediction of the optical components positioning errors (decenter, tilt & air gap). Calculated errors probabilities were validated on a real lenses barrels assembly using a high precision centering machine. Results show that the statistical error prediction is more accurate and that can relax significantly the precision required in comparison to the worst case method. Manufacturing, inspection, adjustment mechanism and alignment cost can then be reduced considerably. © 2012 SPIE.","Analysis; Cost reduction; Manufacturing; Monte Carlo; Optomechanics; Simulation; Statistic; Tolerance","Adjustment mechanisms; Analysis; Manufacturing precision; MONTE CARLO; Opto-mechanics; Simulation; Statistical tolerancing; Tolerance analysis methods; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Errors; Fits and tolerances; Industrial applications; Manufacture; Normal distribution; Optical systems; Statistics; Monte Carlo methods"

Its objective is finding habitable exoplanets around M dwarfs through radial velocity measurements (m/s level) in the near-infrared. Consequently, the NIR spectrograph is highly constraint regarding thermal/mechanical requirements. Indeed, the requirements used for the present study limit the thermal stability to ±0.01K (within year period) over a working temperature of 243K in order to minimise radial velocity drifts. This can be achieved by implementing a solution based on several temperature- controlled rooms (TCR), whose smallest room encloses the vacuum vessel which houses the spectrograph's optomechanics. Nevertheless, several options have been taken into account to minimise the complexity of the thermal design: 1) Large thermal inertia of the system, where, given a thermal instability of the environment (typically, ±0.1K), the optomechanical system remains stable within ±0.01K in the long run; 2) Environment thermal control, where thermal stability is ensured by controlling the temperature of the environment surrounding the vacuum vessel.

This is a near ideal geometry, since lens alignment normal to the axis is typically most critical, axial position is less so, and azimuth is irrelevant. The mechanical constraints correspond to the optical requirements, so the arrangement is as simple as possible and no simpler. Location is kinematic or semi-kinematic, and hence repeatable, allowing for quick, accurate swapping between setups, with critical adjustments made once. Axial position can be without influencing lateral position and tilt. Likewise, rotation alone can be done. Self checking alignment methods can be used. The approach is compatible with other means of mounting.

Recent interest in metallic sandwich mirrors, where the optical surface is separated from the back surface by a lightweighted core, has created a need for a method to correct wavefront aberrations other than by applying actuator forces. One possible way to deform the optical surface of a sandwich mirror is by independently pressurizing cells within the core of the mirror. A method of active correction utilizing independent pressurized 'macrocells' in the core of an 18 in. diameter perforated aluminum honeycomb sandwich mirror has been attempted. This paper describes the experiments and the finite element analyses conducted on 6 in. mirror blanks containing progressively more complex single macrocells and the experiments conducted on two 18 in. mirror blanks, one with a cellular honeycomb core and the other with a machined aluminum core, each containing 19 individual macrocells. Results from the multiple macrocell mirror blanks show that establishing a spatially variable pressure distribution in the core of a sandwich mirror can be an effective active method for deforming the mirror's optical surface.",,"Computer Simulation--Applications; Mathematical Techniques--Finite Element Method; Optical Systems; Optics; Active Optics; Active Surface Correction; Adaptive Optical Components; Metallic Honeycomb Sandwich Mirrors; Optomechanics; Pressurized Honeycomb Core; Mirrors"

Here we design and fabricate a silicon optomechanical circuit with both optical and mechanical connectivity between two optomechanical cavities. Driving the two cavities with phase-correlated laser light results in a synthetic magnetic flux, which, in combination with dissipative coupling to the mechanical bath, leads to non-reciprocal transport of photons with 35 dB of isolation. Additionally, optical pumping with blue-detuned light manifests as a particle non-conserving interaction between photons and phonons, resulting in directional optical amplification of 12 dB in the isolator through-direction. These results suggest the possibility of using optomechanical circuits to create a more general class of non-reciprocal optical devices, and further, to enable new topological phases for both light and sound on a microchip.",,

Distinguishing the harmful defects from the benign defects is a critical problem in the mechanics of materials for solar energy conversion. Interestingly, the visible light absorbed by silicon in the same part of the solar spectrum that is used to generate photocurrent, can also excite photoluminescence, which may be used to generate images of the microstructure. Slightly longer wavelengths in the near infrared (IR) may be used to measure strain in the material via photoelastic (PE) imaging. These two imaging modalities have recently been combined in a single instrument, and we show here the additional capability to identify and categorize defects directly by capturing the narrow band of photoluminescence emitted by regions of high dislocation density. We use this method to show that dislocations arranged in low angle grain boundaries emit polarized light, while dislocation structures in neighboring high angle grain boundaries do not emit polarized light. This capability may form the basis for next-generation, full-field optomechanics-based characterization of materials for solar energy conversion. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,

We find that transient chaos, besides being a physically meaningful phenomenon by itself, provides a resolution. Using the method of quantum state diffusion to simulate the system dynamics subject to continuous homodyne detection, we uncover transient chaos associated with quantum trajectories. The transient behavior is consistent with chaos in the classical limit, while the long term evolution of the quantum system is regular. Transient chaos thus serves as a bridge for the quantum-classical transition (QCT). Strikingly, as the system transitions from the quantum to the classical regime, the average chaotic transient lifetime increases dramatically (faster than the Ehrenfest time characterizing the QCT for isolated quantum systems).

However, the low measured quality factor of TMD resonators has been a roadblock so far. Here, we report an ultrasensitive optical readout of monolayer TMD resonators that allows us to reveal their mechanical properties at cryogenic temperatures. We find that the quality factor of monolayer WSe2 resonators greatly increases below room temperature, reaching values as high as 1.6 × 104 at liquid nitrogen temperature and 4.7 × 104 at liquid helium temperature. This surpasses the quality factor of monolayer graphene resonators with similar surface areas. Upon cooling the resonator, the resonant frequency increases significantly due to the thermal contraction of the WSe2 lattice. These measurements allow us to experimentally study the thermal expansion coefficient of WSe2 monolayers for the first time. High Q-factors are also found in resonators based on MoS2 and MoSe2 monolayers.

Their composition changes during processes such as wound healing and fibrosis. When excited by ultraviolet light, collagens exhibit autofluorescence distinguishable by their unique fluorescent lifetimes across a range of emission wavelengths. Here, we designed a miniaturized spectral-lifetime detection system as a noninvasive probe for monitoring tissue collagen compositions. A sine-modulated LED illumination was applied to enable frequency domain fluorescence lifetime measurements under three wavelength bands, separated via a series of longpass dichroics at 387, 409, and 435 nm. We employed a lithography-based three-dimensional (3-D) printer with <50 μm resolution to create a custom designed optomechanics in a handheld form factor. We examined the characteristics of the optomechanics with finite element modeling to simulate the effect of thermal (from LED) and mechanical (from handling) strain on the optical system. The geometry was further optimized with ray tracing to form the final 3-D printed structure. Using this device, the phase shift and demodulation of collagen types were measured, where the separate spectral bands enhanced the differentiation of their lifetimes.

Apart from practical reasons, such a scenario is very interesting from a fundamental point of view, because it allows exploration of the optomechanical interaction in the presence of a strongly quantum-correlated field, the spontaneously down-converted mode. In this work we analyze this problem from two approximate but valuable perspectives: the classical limit and the limit of small quantum fluctuations. We show that, in the presence of optomechanical coupling, the well-known classical phase diagram of the optical problem is modified by the appearance of additional dynamical instabilities. As for the quantum-mechanical description, we prove the ability of the squeezed down-converted field to cool down the mechanical motion not only to thermal but also to squeezed thermal mechanical states, and in a way that can be much less sensitive to the parameters (e.g., detuning of the driving laser) than standard sideband cooling. © 2016 American Physical Society.",,"Nonlinear optics; Optical frequency conversion; Parametric oscillators; Quantum electronics; Dynamical instabilities; Mechanical motions; Nonlinear optical process; Quantum correlated; Quantum fluctuation; Quantum mechanical; Quantum technologies; Spontaneous parametric down conversion; Quantum theory"

But in addition to future applications, such quantum technologies have already provided us with the possibility of accessing quantum-mechanical scenarios that seemed unreachable just a few decades ago. With this spirit, in this work we show that modern optomechanical setups are mature enough to implement one of the most elusive models in the field of open system dynamics: degenerate parametric oscillation. Introduced in the eighties and motivated by its alleged implementability in nonlinear optical resonators, it rapidly became a paradigm for the study of dissipative phase transitions whose corresponding spontaneously broken symmetry is discrete. However, it was found that the intrinsic multimode nature of optical cavities makes it impossible to experimentally study the model all the way through its phase transition. In contrast, here we show that this long-awaited model can be implemented in the motion of a mechanical object dispersively coupled to the light contained in a cavity, when the latter is properly driven with multichromatic laser light. We focus on membranes as the mechanical element, showing that the main signatures of the degenerate parametric oscillation model can be studied in state-of-the-art setups, thus opening the possibility of analyzing spontaneous symmetry breaking and enhanced metrology in one of the cleanest dissipative phase transitions.

Optical or microwave cavities containing a Kerr nonlinearity are known to potentially yield large levels of squeezing, which have been recently observed in optomechanics and nonlinear superconducting circuit platforms. Such Kerr-cavity squeezing however suffers from two fundamental drawbacks. First, optimal squeezing requires working close to turning points of a bistable cycle, which are highly unstable against noise thus rendering optimal squeezing inaccessible. Second, the light field has a macroscopic coherent component corresponding to the pump, making it less versatile than the so-called squeezed vacuum, characterised by a null mean field.

Using instantaneous Lorentz transformations, we deduce the set of self-consistent equations governing the dynamics of the system and we obtain approximate equations to first order in the velocity and the acceleration of the slab. As a consequence of the motion of the slab, the field must satisfy a wave equation with damping and slowly varying coefficients plus terms that are small when the time-scale of the evolution of the mirror is much larger than that of the field. Also, the motion of the slab and its interaction with the field introduce two effects in the slab's equation of motion.

We show that in comparison with a bare optomechanical cavity, the combination of the cavity energy shift due to the weak Kerr nonlinearity and increase in the intracavity photon number due to the nonlinear gain medium can increase the normal mode splitting in the displacement spectrum of the oscillating mirror. Our study demonstrates that at high temperatures, when the thermal fluctuations in the system are important, the optomechanical and nonlinearity-induced resonances are distinguishable in the output field spectrum. However, at low temperatures, the presence of both nonlinearities enhances the amplitude of the mechanical-mode contribution to the spectrum and leads to the occurrence of normal-mode splitting in the transmitted field spectrum even for low values of the input power. Also, at low temperatures, the Kerr-down conversion nonlinearity increases the radiation pressure contribution to the degree of squeezing of the transmitted field more than that of a bare optomechanical cavity or a nonlinear cavity (in the absence of optomechanical coupling). Furthermore, we find that for the blue-detuned laser the Kerr nonlinearity extends the domain of the stability of the system and leads to the normal-mode splitting of the movable mirror and noise reduction in the range of frequencies in which a bare cavity is not stable. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","cavity optomechanics; Kerr-down conversion nonlinearity; normal mode splitting; squeezing spectrum","Mirrors; Noise abatement; Optical Kerr effect; System stability; Cavity optomechanics; Down conversion; Normal modes; Opto-mechanical systems; Optomechanical cavities; Oscillating mirrors; squeezing spectrum; Thermal fluctuations; Laser mirrors"

This indirect evidence implies that DM accounts for as much as 84.5% of all matter in our Universe, yet it has so far evaded all attempts at direct detection, leaving such confirmation and the consequent discovery of its nature as one of the biggest challenges in modern physics. Here we present a novel form of low-mass DM χ that would have been missed by all experiments so far. While its large interaction strength might at first seem unlikely, neither constraints from particle physics nor cosmological/astronomical observations are sufficient to rule out this type of DM, and it motivates our proposal for direct detection by optomechanics technology which should soon be within reach, namely, through the precise position measurement of a levitated mesoscopic particle which will be perturbed by elastic collisions with χ particles.

The motion of a mechanical resonator is transduced onto quadrature fluctuations of a cavity optical field and a measurement is performed on the optical field exiting the cavity. We compare measurement sensitivities obtained with coherent probing and quantum-enhanced probing of the mechanical motion, i.e. the coherent probe field carries vacuum states and quadrature squeezed vacuum states at sideband frequencies, respectively. We find that quantum-enhanced probing provides little to no improvement in motion sensing for resonators in the unresolved sideband regime but may significantly increase measurement sensitivities for resonators in the resolved sideband regime. © 2014 by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A method for predicting stretching force was derived. Two models were then developed: Model 1 held the equatorial geometry constant at all stages of accommodation, while Model 2 allowed localized deformation at the equator. Both models were compared to recent data for axial thickness, anterior and posterior radii of curvature, surface area, cross-sectional area, volume, and stretching force for the 29-year-old lens. Age-related changes in accommodation were also simulated. Model 1 gave predictions which agreed with the Helmholtz theory of accommodation, while Model 2's predictions agreed with the Schachar mechanism of accommodation. Trends predicted by Model 1 agreed with all available experimental data, while Model 2 disagreed with recent surface area measurements. Further analysis indicated that Model 1 was fundamentally more efficient in that it required less force per diopter change in optical power than Model 2. Model 1 more accurately predicted age-related changes in accommodation amplitude. This implies that the zero-force (fully accommodated) state geometry changes with age due to a shifting balance in residual stresses between the lens and capsule. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Accommodation; Lens; Lens curvature; Lens stretching; Optomechanics; Presbyopia","accommodation; aging; amplitude modulation; Article; biomechanics; controlled study; cornea curvature; eye axis thickness; force; force gauge; Helmholtz theory of accomodation; lens; lens gauge; lens power; mathematical computing; mathematical model; predictive value; predictor variable; presbyopia; Schachar theory of accomodation; stretching force; theoretical model; visual system parameters; accommodation; adult; anatomy and histology; elasticity; human; lens; pathophysiology; physiology; presbyopia; theoretical model; Accommodation, Ocular; Adult; Aging; Elasticity; Humans; Lens, Crystalline; Models, Theoretical; Presbyopia"

Here, we employ lattice mismatch in epitaxial growth to impart an intrinsic tensile strain to a monocrystalline thin film (approximately 30 nm thick). These structures exhibit mechanical quality factors of 2 × 106 or beyond at room temperature and 17 K for eigenfrequencies up to 1 MHz, yielding Q × f products of 2 × 1012 Hz for a tensile stress of ∼170 MPa.

Further reductions of the In content of this alloy will enable tensile stress levels of 1 GPa, with the potential for a significant increase in the Q × f product, assuming no deterioration in the mechanical loss at this composition and strain level.

In particular, RIMAS will be used to perform photometric and spectroscopic observations of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows to compliment the Swift satellite's science goals. Upon completion, RIMAS will be installed on Lowell Observatory's 4.3 meter Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT) located in Happy Jack, Arizona. The instrument's optical design includes a collimator lens assembly, a dichroic to divide the wavelength coverage into two optical arms (0.9 - 1.4 microns and 1.4 - 2.4 microns respectively), and a camera lens assembly for each optical arm. Because the wavelength coverage extends out to 2.4 microns, all optical elements are cooled to ∼70 K. Filters and transmission gratings are located on wheels prior to each camera allowing the instrument to be quickly configured for photometry or spectroscopy. An athermal optomechanical design is being implemented to prevent lenses from loosing their room temperature alignment as the system is cooled. The thermal expansion of materials used in this design have been measured in the lab. Additionally, RIMAS has a guide camera consisting of four lenses to aid observers in passing light from target sources through spectroscopic slits.

They couple to many different quantum systems such as spins, optical photons, and Bose Einstein condensates. It is difficult to measure and manipulate a phonon state due to the tiny motion in the quantum regime. On the other hand, microwave resonators are powerful quantum devices since arbitrary photon states can be synthesized and measured with the quantum tomography. We show that linear coupling, strong and controlled with gate voltage, between mechanical and microwave resonators enables creation of quantum phonon states, manipulation of hybrid entanglement between phonons and photons, and generation of entanglement between two mechanical oscillators. In circuit quantum optomechanics, the mechanical resonator acts as a quantum transducer between an auxiliary quantum system and the microwave resonator, which is used as a quantum bus.

This is to allow enough space for the later deployment of the MUSE Adaptive Optics module GALACSI, in-between the telescope adapter rotator and the instrument itself. The UT guide probe is a critical component for the successful operation of the telescope, so its modification to increase the telescope's back focal length, while maintaining full compatibility with the existing operation model and other hardware, was rather demanding. The design, manufacture, assembly and test for the new supporting arm in the UT guiding probe is presented. It mixes the use of novel materials (HB-CESIC® for the mirrors substrates) and state of the art manufacturing techniques (3D printing mould production and rapid casting for the support structure), which allow producing easily a high performance subsystem. Characterization of the system prior delivery to the telescope, its integration in the UT and results after commissioning is presented.

The analysis of the most used Risley prisms scanners, with rotational elements has been approached in different ways, to determine exactly or approximately their scan patterns. While we have previously developed such an exact analysis using mechanical design programs, in this paper a first multi-parametric analysis is carried out, for two of the possible configurations of scanners with two rotational prisms.

The instrument is designed to observe gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows following their initial detection by the Swift satellite. RIMAS will operate in the near infrared (0.9 - 2.4 microns) with all of its optics cooled to ~60 K. The primary optical design includes a collimator lens assembly, a dichroic dividing the wavelength coverage into the ""YJ band"" and ""HK band"" optical arms, and camera lens assemblies for each arm. Additionally, filters and dispersive elements are attached to wheels positioned prior to each arm's camera, allowing the instrument to quickly change from its imaging modes to spectroscopic modes. Optics have also been designed to image the sky surrounding spectroscopic slits to help observers pass light from target sources through these slits. Because the optical systems are entirely cryogenic, it was necessary to account for changing refractive indices and model the effects of thermal contraction. One result of this work is a lens mount design that keeps lenses centered on the optical axis as the system is cooled.

Using the two-laser technique, in this paper, we theoretically devise a protocol for quantum light memory via a cavity optomechanical system composed of a Fabry-Perot cavity and a mechanical resonator. Due to the long-lived mechanical resonator, this quantum memory for light based on optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) can serve as a long-term memory that can store the full quantum light contained in an optical pulse. It is shown that, with the tunable pump laser, the quantum signal light can be reaccelerated and converted back on demand.

Starting from the principle of the lateral shearing interferometer, it analyses the decline reason for the signal modulation efficiency and theoretically analyses the several aspects of the surface errors of the plane mirror, the beamsplitter properties change and the incident light angle influence the modulation efficiency. Based on analysis results, some expressions of modulation efficiency are provided. Furthermore, the relationship between modulation efficiency and performance parameters is pointed out. The reasons for the interferometer signal modulation efficiency decline can contain the following several aspects: (1) the influence of the surface errors of the plane mirror, (2) the polarization state change because of the influence of the reflection and the transmission in the light incident process makes the signal modulation efficiency decline, (3) the influence of the incident light angle. The results show that: this class of system is inherently optomechanics robust, no-moving part system, simple and compact structure, easy assembly and adjustment, strong vibration resistance as well as high resolution and high-throughput.

This goal is motivated by the need for in-stream data to support both ground and flight tests of scramjet engine designs. While particular fundamental hypersonic flow problems are addressable using well-established laser-based techniques, advanced engine concepts using axisymmetric hardware typically have minimal optical access making some of the more traditional techniques difficult to deploy. To meet the need we have an ongoing in-house program to mature diode-laser-based techniques for application in hypersonic flows. Additional motivation for developing diode-laser-based measurement strategies comes from the need for flight sensors. Flight-worthy packages must be small, light, low-power and rugged. For measurement objectives in both ground and flight experiments we have adopted tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy making heavy use of fiber coupling and integrated optomechanics. Water-based measurements of temperature, pressure, velocity, and water mole fraction are executed using time-multiplexed near-infrared diodes. These fundamental flow parameters can be combined to yield optical mass capture and thrust. Similar measurements can be made in inlets using an oxygen-based strategy employing visible diodes. In this paper we summarize the absorption sensor work done to date in AFRL. Particular attention will be paid to the fact that a single hardware platform can be used to capture absorption, non-resonant transmission, and optical emission signals all three of which provide relevant information.",,"Aerospace propulsion; Air breathing; Axisymmetric; Fiber couplings; Flight experiments; Flight sensors; Flight test; Flow parameters; Flow properties; Hardware platform; Hypersonic engines; Laser-based techniques; Low Power; Measurement strategies; Near Infrared; Nonresonant; Optical access; Optical emissions; Optical technique; Opto-mechanics; Scramjet engines; Time multiplexed; Traditional techniques; Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy; Water based; Water mole fraction; Aerospace engineering; Air engines; Diodes; Exhibitions; Hardware; Lasers; Sensors; Stream flow; Hypersonic flow"

The compact white-pupil design of the instrument optics uses seven cryogenic mirrors, including three aspherical off-axis collimators and four flat fold mirrors. In this study, we introduce the optomechanical mount designs of three off-axis collimating mirrors and one flat slit-viewer fold mirror. Two of the off-axis collimators are serving as H and K-band pupil transfer mirrors, and are designed as system alignment compensators in combination with the H2RG focal plane array detectors in each channel. For this reason, the mount designs include tip-tilt and parallel translation adjustment mechanisms to properly perform the precision alignment function. This means that the off-axis mirrors' optomechanical mount designs are among the most sensitive tasks in all IGRINS system hardware. The other flat fold mirror is designed within its very limitedly allowed work space. This slit-viewer fold mirror is mounted with its own version of the six-point kinematic optics mount. The design work consists of a computer-aided 3D modeling and finite element analysis (FEA) technique to optimize the structural stability and the thermal behavior of the mount models. From the structural and thermal FEA studies, we conclude that the four IGRINS mirror mounts are well designed to meet all optical stability tolerances and system thermal requirements. © The Korean Space Science Society.","Collimator; Cryogenic optomechanics; Finite element analysis; Immersion grating infrared spectrometer; Off-axis mirror; Structural analysis; Thermal analysis",

Only this ability permits the engineer to be sure to keep the surface tensile stresses under an acceptable level. A review of the literature of optomechanics and structural mechanics fails to disclose a consistent procedure for calculating the stresses in the surface of the glass. The most popular method (Delgado and Hallinan) is a hybrid technique (employing both cylinders and spheres) that the author finds predicts surface tensile stresses that are unrealistically high. The author has gone back to the elastic theory, derived the differential equations for the ring-mounted-lens geometry and integrated them to calculate the state of stress in the glass surface under the influence of compressive loading from metal retaining rings. The results are presented as closed-form equations for the state of stress over the entire surface of the lens. The implications for the design of retaining ring mountings are discussed. © 2009 SPIE.","Glass lenses; Retaining rings; Tensile stress","Closed-form equations; Compressive loading; Consistent procedures; Elastic theory; Glass lens; Glass lenses; Glass surfaces; Hybrid techniques; Lens geometry; Lens mount; Metal rings; Opto-mechanics; Retaining ring; Retaining rings; State of stress; Structural mechanics; Surface tensile stress; Differential equations; Fasteners; Glass; Lenses; Stress analysis; Tensile stress; Optical instruments"

Angular misalignment of the laser source to the multimode fiber can lead to unusual angular patterns at the exit of the fiber. The angular content of the launch beam can result in under-filling, non-uniform angular filling, or over-filling of the MMF modes. Typically, the beam condition optics at the distal end of the device has a limited impact on these angular modes. The result is often loss of output power at the distal end or an uncontrolled angular and/or spatial distribution of light. We have investigated angular misalignment perturbations of various fiber and coupling optics combinations in a medical laser therapy device. We have quantified the resulting far field perturbations, as well as the resulting broadening of the fiber output numerical aperture (NA). Angular misalignment may cause the development of so called ""donut modes"" with highly inhomogeneous far field mode distribution, as well as a substantial NA broadening effect which may impact therapy. We have shown that in order to avoid these perturbations, tight tolerancing of fiber coupling optomechanics as well as a thorough alignment procedure is required. © 2009 SPIE.","All-silica fibers; Fiber-optic coupling; Medical fiber; Medical laser systems; Mode field perturbation; Optoelectronics packaging","All-silica fibers; Medical fiber; Medical laser systems; Mode field perturbation; Optoelectronics packaging; Alignment; Angular distribution; Applications; Dense wavelength division multiplexing; Fiber optics; Lasers; Light; Multimode fibers; Optical materials; Optical sensors; Optoelectronic devices; Silica; Size distribution; Sodium compounds; Fibers"

Central to this advance are devices and materials supporting ultra-long-lived photonic and phononic excitations that enable novel regimes of classical and quantum dynamics based on tailorable photon-phonon coupling. Silica-based devices have been at the forefront of such innovations for their ability to support optical excitations persisting for nearly 1 billion cycles, and for their low optical nonlinearity. While acoustic phonon modes can persist for a similar number of cycles in crystalline solids at cryogenic temperatures, it has not been possible to achieve such performance in silica, as silica becomes acoustically opaque at low temperatures. We demonstrate that these intrinsic forms of phonon dissipation are greatly reduced (by >90%) by nonlinear saturation using continuous drive fields of disparate frequencies. The result is a form of steady-state phononic spectral hole burning that produces a wideband transparency window with optically generated phonon fields of modest (nW) powers. We developed a simple model that explains both dissipative and dispersive changes produced by phononic saturation.

In both respects, a mechanical resonator formed from superfluid liquid helium offers several appealing features: low electromagnetic absorption, high thermal conductivity, vanishing viscosity, well-understood mechanical loss, and in situ alignment with cryogenic cavities. In addition, it offers degrees of freedom that differ qualitatively from those of a solid. Here, we describe an optomechanical system consisting of a miniature optical cavity filled with superfluid helium. The cavity mirrors define optical and mechanical modes with near-perfect overlap, resulting in an optomechanical coupling rate 1/43 kHz.

When applied to muscle cells, mechanical events can be controlled through a process that could be termed ""optomechanics."" Besides functioning as an optical on/off switch, we hypothesized that optomechanical control could include the ability to manipulate the strength and duration of contraction events. To explore this possibility, we constructed an electromechanical model of the human ventricular cardiomyocyte while adding a representation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a light-activated channel commonly used in optogenetics. Two hybrid stimulus protocols were developed that combined light-based stimuli with traditional electrical current (all-or-none) excitation. The first protocol involved delivery of a subthreshold optical stimulus followed 50-90 ms later by an electrical stimulus. The result was a graded inhibition of peak cellular twitch force in concert with a prolongation of the intracellular Ca2+ transient. The second protocol was comprised of an electrical stimulus followed by a long light pulse (250-350 ms) that acted to prolong the cardiac action potential (AP). This created a pulse duration-dependent prolongation of the intracellular Ca2+ transient that in turn altered the rate of muscle relaxation without changing peak twitch force. These results illustrate the feasibility of acute, optomechanical manipulation of cardiomyocyte contraction and suggest that this approach could be used to probe the dynamic behavior of the cardiac sarcomere without altering its intrinsic properties. Other experimentally meaningful stimulus protocols could be designed by making use of the optomechanical cardiomyocyte model presented here. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Calcium; Cell membranes; Muscle; Cardiac action potential; Cardiomyocyte contraction; Cellular membranes; Dynamic behaviors; Electrical current; Electrical stimuli; Electromechanical modeling; Intrinsic property; Light"

Further progress requires thermalizing such sensors to low temperatures, where sensitivity limitations are instead imposed by quantum noise.

A particular question is whether gravity causes decoherence. Several models for gravitational decoherence have been proposed, not all of which can be described quantum mechanically. Since quantum mechanics may need to be modified, one may question the use of quantum mechanics as a calculational tool to draw conclusions from the data of experiments concerning gravity. Here we propose a general method to estimate gravitational decoherence in an experiment that allows us to draw conclusions in any physical theory where the no-signalling principle holds, even if quantum mechanics needs to be modified. As an example, we propose a concrete experiment using optomechanics. Our work raises the interesting question whether other properties of nature could similarly be established from experimental observations alone-that is, without already having a rather well-formed theory of nature to make sense of experimental data. © 2016 The Author(s).",,

Two optomechanical cavities, one in each arm, are placed in a Michelson interferometer. The interferometer is placed on a rotating table and is moved with a uniform velocity of y with respect to the rotating table. The Coriolis force acting on the interferometer changes the length of the optomechanical cavity in one arm, while the length of the optomechanical cavity in the other arm is not changed. The phase shift corresponding to the change in the optomechanical cavity length is measured at the interferometer output to estimate the angular velocity of the absolute rotation. An analytic expression for the minimum detectable rotation rate corresponding to the standard quantum limit of measurable Coriolis force in the interferometer is derived. Squeezing technique is discussed to improve the rotation detection sensitivity by a factor of √γm/ωm at 0 Ktemperature, where γm and ωm are the damping rate and angular frequency of the mechanical oscillator.

The key ingredient is that the polarizability from the ensemble of embedded quantum emitters can be larger than the bulk polarizability of the sphere, thereby enabling the use of repulsive optical potentials and consequently the levitation using optical near fields. In levitated cavity quantum optomechanics, this could be used to boost the single-photon coupling by combining larger polarizability to mass ratio, larger field gradients, and smaller cavity volumes while remaining in the resolved sideband regime and at room temperature.

In this paper we theoretically consider two damping regimes of an optically levitated nanoparticle cooled by cavityless parametric feedback. Our treatment is based on a generalized Fokker-Planck equation derived from the quantum master equation presented recently and shown to agree very well with experiment [B. Rodenburg, L. P. Neukirch, A. N. Vamivakas, and M. Bhattacharya, Quantum model of cooling and force sensing with an optically trapped nanoparticle, Optica 3, 318 (2016)2334-253610.1364/OPTICA.3.000318]. For low damping, we find that the resulting Wigner function yields the single-peaked oscillator position distribution and recovers the appropriate energy distribution derived earlier using a classical theory and verified experimentally [J. Gieseler, R. Quidant, C. Dellago, and L. Novotny, Dynamic relaxation of a levitated nanoparticle from a non-equilibrium steady state, Nat. Nano. 9, 358 (2014)1748-338710.1038/nnano.2014.40]. For high damping, in contrast, we predict a double-peaked position distribution, which we trace to an underlying bistability induced by feedback. Unlike in cavity-based optomechanics, stochastic processes play a major role in determining the bistable behavior. To support our conclusions, we present analytical expressions as well as numerical simulations using the truncated Wigner function approach. Our work opens up the prospect of developing bistability-based devices, characterization of phase-space dynamics, and investigation of the quantum-classical transition using levitated nanoparticles. © 2016 American Physical Society.",,"Damping; Nanoparticles; Phase space methods; Quantum theory; Random processes; Stochastic systems; Wave functions; Wigner-Ville distribution; Analytical expressions; Energy distributions; Macroscopic quantum; Non-equilibrium steady state; Parametric feedback; Phase-space dynamics; Quantum master equations; Trapped nanoparticles; Fokker Planck equation"

In the parameter regime relevant to ground-state cooling, the optical backaction and imprecision noise set the bottleneck of achievable cooling and must be carefully balanced. This can be achieved by adapting the phase of the local oscillator in the homodyne detection realizing a so-called variational measurement. The trade-off between accurate position measurement and minimal disturbance can be understood in terms of Heisenbergs microscope and becomes particularly relevant when the measurement and feedback processes happen to be fast within the quantum coherence time of the system to be cooled. This corresponds to the regime of large quantum cooperativity Cq ≳ 1, which was achieved in recent experiments on feedback cooling.

The system is constituted by two identical, optically coupled optomechanical systems. The protocol consists of two steps. In the first, one of the two optical resonators is excited by a resonant external π-like Gaussian optical pulse. When the optical excitation coherently partly transfers to the second cavity, the second step starts. It consists of sending simultaneously two additional π-like Gaussian optical pulses, one at each optical resonator, with specific frequencies. In the optomechanical ultrastrong coupling regime, when the coupling strength becomes a significant fraction of the mechanical frequency, we show that NOON mechanical states with quite high Fock states can be deterministically obtained.

In particular, some components have strong requirements regarding their tilt stability that is often in the 10 μrad range. In most of the cases components and packages that are used for industrial lasers do not fulfil all those requirements. Thus, the packaging of all these key components has been developed to meet those specifications only making use of metal and ceramics beside the optical component itself. All joints between the optical component and the laser baseplate are soldered or screwed. No clamps or adhesives are used. Most of the critical properties like tilting after temperature cycling have been proven in several tests. Currently, these components are used to build up first prototypes for spaceborne systems. © 2016 SPIE.","faraday isolator; laser crystal; optomechanics; pockels cell; Solid state lasers; spaceborne lasers","Climatology; Microwave isolators; Optical radar; Organic lasers; Packaging; Pulse repetition rate; Solid state lasers; Vibrations (mechanical); Faraday isolators; Laser crystals; Opto-mechanics; Pockels cell; Space-borne; Laser mirrors; Crystals; Lasers"

We begin with an introduction of the damped and the undamped classical harmonic oscillator, followed by an overview of the quantum mechanical description of this system. A brief review of both the classical and quantum autocorrelation functions (ACFs) and PSDs follows. We then introduce a general method by which the kth-order PSD for the harmonic oscillator can be calculated, where k is any positive integer. This formulation is verified by first reproducing the known results for the k=. 1 case of the linear PSD. It is then extended to calculate the second-order PSD, useful in the field of quantum measurement, corresponding to the k=. 2 case of the generalized method. In this process, damping is included into each of the quantum linear and quadratic PSDs, producing realistic models for the PSDs found in experiment. These quantum PSDs are shown to obey the correspondence principle by matching with what was calculated for their classical counterparts in the high temperature, high-. Q limit. Finally, we demonstrate that our results can be reproduced using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, providing an independent check of our resultant PSDs. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Harmonic oscillator; Nonlinear optomechanics; Power spectral density; Quantum nondemolition measurement",

It is shown that the presence of atoms can transfer the optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) window into the steeper Fano shapes and the broader normal-mode splitting shapes. We find that the transmission group delay related to the Fano resonance is much greater than that of the OMIT and normal-mode splitting at the resonances, meanwhile, with the growing of the atomic number, the slow light becomes increasingly significant. The value of reflection group delay related to the OMIT and normal-mode splitting is positive, while the value related to the Fano resonance is significantly negative. This indicates that the reflection parts of output field contain both slow light and fast light. Therefore, via changing the atomic number and detuning, we can realize not only the manipulation of the magnitudes of the group delay and advance, but also a tunable switch from slow light to fast light. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Atom-assisted optomechanics; Fano resonances; Normal-mode splitting; Optomechanically induced transparency; Slow and fast light","Atom lasers; Atoms; Group delay; Resonance; Transparency; Fano resonances; Normal modes; Opto-mechanics; Optomechanically induced transparencies; Slow and fast light; Slow light"

Here, we present a scheme to cool a mechanical resonator to its ground state in finite time using a chirped pulse. We show that there is distinct advantage in using the chirp-pulse scheme to cool a resonator rapidly. The cooling behaviors of dispersively and dissipatively coupled system is also explored with different types of incident pulses and different coupling strengths. Our scheme is feasible in cooling the resonator for a wide range of the parameter region.",,

As it is the aim to extend the use of optical squeezing as a tool for improving quantum limited displacement sensing at low frequency, a family of opto-mechanical devices designed to work at frequencies of about 100 kHz was developed. The devices actually meet the initial design goals, but new requirements have emerged from the analysis of their behavior in optical cavities, due to the interaction between the cavity locking system and the low order normal modes of the devices. © 2014 by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This behavior is expected for a birefringent object. We have measured the birefringence of distortion-free RBCs in an isotonic medium using a polarizing microscope. The birefringence is confined to the cell's dimple region and the slow axis is along a diameter. We report an average retardation of 3.5 ± 1.5 nm for linearly polarized green light (λ = 546 nm). We also estimate a retardation of 1.87 ± 0.09 nm from the optomechanical response of the RBC in an optical trap. We reason that the birefringence is a property of the cell membrane and propose a simple model attributing the origin of birefringence to the phospholipid molecules in the lipid bilayer and the variation to the membrane curvature. We observe that RBCs reconstituted in shape subsequent to crenation show diminished birefringence along with a sluggish optomechanical response in a trap. As the arrangement of phospholipid molecules in the cell membrane is disrupted on crenation, this lends credence to our conjecture on the origin of birefringence. Dependence of the birefringence on membrane contours is further illustrated through studies on chicken RBCs. © 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Biomedical optics; Birefringence; Microscopy","Blood; Cell membranes; Cells; Cytology; Lipid bilayers; Microscopic examination; Molecules; Phospholipids; Polarization; Biomedical optics; Electric polarization; Human red blood cell; Linearly polarized lasers; Membrane curvature; Optomechanical response; Phospholipid molecules; Polarizing microscopes; Birefringence; adult; animal; birefringence; chemistry; chicken; erythrocyte; human; optical tweezers; polarization microscopy; procedures; young adult; Adult; Animals; Birefringence; Chickens; Erythrocytes; Humans; Microscopy, Polarization; Optical Tweezers; Young Adult"

Because nanoscale waveguides are closely size-matched to nanomechanical devices, strong optomechanical interactions arise which can be harnessed in optical systems. The additional mechanical degrees of freedom provided by optomechanical devices are of particular interest for material systems in which tunability of the optical properties is not readily available. Here, suitable materials for the realization of chip-based optomechanical circuits are discussed and analyzed in terms of performance and the achievable quality factors. In particular, materials that offer large electronic band gaps are of interest, because in this case broadband optical transparency is achieved, combined with reduced free carrier effects. Several device geometries that can be used for enhancing optical forces are presented which address both an increase in the field gradient and the net optical force through resonant enhancement. Combining a variety of optomechanical components into full circuits thus provides a new route toward functional nanophotonic circuits with applications in sensing and optical signal processing in a chip-scale framework. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",,"Electric network analysis; Nanophotonics; Optical signal processing; Signal processing; Mechanical structures; Nano-scale waveguides; Nanomechanical device; Nanophotonic circuits; Nanophotonic integrated circuits; Optical transparency; Optomechanical components; Resonant enhancements; Optical properties"

We find that the value of phase of the field driving the OPA and the nonlinear gain of the OPA will evidently affect the width of the optomechanically induced transparency window and the property of the normal mode splitting. In particular, when the coupling field works at the mechanical red sideband, narrower transparency window than the case of empty cavity (no OPA) can be realized by adjusting the value of phase of the field driving the OPA and the nonlinear gain of the OPA, accompanied by the steep dispersion curve.

Owing to its compact optical layout compared to conventional reflective AOs, the instrument size can be reduced to only 0.03 square meters. We plan to apply this miniaturization technique into future AOs on a variety of telescopes ranging from 1m- to 30m-class. CRAO is installed at a Nasmyth focus of the 1.3m Araki telescope at Koyama Astronomical Observatory in Kyoto Sangyo University. CRAO adopts a closed-loop single-conjugate system with wavelength coverage of 400 - 700 nm and the field of view of 30 arcsec. For low cost, we also employ commercial products on its wavefront sensor (WFS), deformable mirror (DM), and tip-tilt (TT) stage. CRAO is designed to improve the atmospheric seeing from 2.5 to 0.6arcsec under a typical condition at Koyama Astronomical Observatory with 12x12 subapertures in the WFS, 48 electrodes in the membrane DM and the control bandwidth of 200Hz. In order to examine key issues inherent in refractive optical system such as chromatic aberration, temperature aberration and ghost images, room and on-sky experiments are currently underway. CRAO has seen first light in May 2014, and we have confirmed that effects of chromatic aberration and ghost images induced by its refractive optics are negligible for at least TT correction.

A NEMS structure, which consists of 3 cascaded folded-beam-springs and an electrostatic comb drive, is integrated into the device to finely tune the gap between cavities so that the relation between the cavitiesa resonance shift and their gap changes can be precisely and straightforwardly characterized. Resonance modes of the cavities are utilized to drive the spring structures, which can generate much larger optical forces than waveguide modes due to their high quality factors. The even resonance mode produces an attractive force, while the odd mode produces a repulsive force. In addition, there is the thermo-optic effect accompanying with the optical forces. Here, a decoupling method is also introduced by calibrating the relations of resonance shift versus gap change with the help of the NEMS and resonance shift versus temperature variation in advance. The experimental results show that one cavity is pulled to (pushed away from) the other cavity by 37.1 nm (11.4 nm) for the optomechanical actuator proposed here.

Minimizing optical component positioning errors generally translates into significant cost increases. To maximize the precision-to-cost ratio, there are significant advantages in having both an accurate optomechanical tolerance calculation method and an effective technique to mount and align lenses. This paper presents a tool that has been developed at INO to easily perform complex optomechanical statistical tolerancing using Monte Carlo simulation to reduce manufacturing and alignment costs. This tolerancing method provides a more realistic prediction of optical component errors compared to the classical worst case and root sum square calculations. In addition, precision alignment using elastomeric lens mounting is presented. Thermal stability and often overlooked factors for effective alignments are discussed. Results of tests performed on real optical assemblies are presented for tolerancing, thermal stability and alignment performance.

Temperature changes cause materials to expand and contract causing deformations of optical components. The resulting stress states in transmissive optics can cause refractive changes that can affect optical performance. In addition, the temperature changes themselves can cause changes in the refractive properties of transmissive optics. Complex distributions of refractive indices that relate to the thermal profile, the thermo-optic refractive index profile, within the optical media can be predicted by the finite element method. One current technique for representing such refractive index profiles is through the generation of optical path difference (OPD) maps by integration along integration paths. While computationally efficient, this method has limitations in its ability to represent the effect of the index changes for rays associated with multiple field points and multiple wavelengths. A more complete representation of the thermo-optic refractive index profile may be passed to the optical analysis software through the use of a user defined gradient index material. The interface consists of a dynamic link library (DLL) which supplies indices of refraction to a user defined gradient index lens as ray tracing calculations are being performed. The DLL obtains its refractive index description from a database derived from the thermal analysis of the optics. This process allows optical analysis software to perform accurate ray tracing for an arbitrary refractive index profile induced by changes in temperature. © 2013 SPIE.","Dn/dT; FEA; Integrated analysis; Optomechanics; Thermo-optic","Arbitrary refractive index; Computationally efficient; Dn/dT; Integrated analysis; Opto-mechanics; Ray tracing calculations; Refractive index profiles; Thermooptics; Finite element method; Optical systems; Refractive index; Single mode fibers; Thermoanalysis; Optics"

The atoms are trapped in the intensity maxima of an optical standing wave formed by retroreflection of a laser beam from the membrane surface. Vibrations of the membrane displace the standing wave, thus coupling to the center-of-mass motion of the atomic ensemble. Conversely, atoms imprint their motion onto the laser light, thereby modulating the radiation pressure force on the membrane. In this way, the laser light mediates a long-distance coherent coupling between the two systems. When the trap frequency of the atoms is matched to the membrane frequency, we observe resonant energy transfer. Moreover, we demonstrate sympathetic damping of the membrane motion by coupling it to laser-cooled atoms. Theoretical investigations show that the coupling strength can be considerably enhanced by placing the membrane inside an optical cavity. This could lead to quantum coherent coupling and ground-state cooling of the membrane via a distant atomic ensemble. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2013.",,

The transducer consists of a nanoscale cantilever, a microdisk, waveguides, and pigtailed fibers. A sharpened tip of the cantilever is of 20 nm radius, comparable to commercial atomic force microscopy probes. We demonstrate nanoscale resolution in a contact-mode operation. The detection needs to be improved in order to enhance the resolution. The resonant frequency of the fundamental in-plane mode is ~3.5 MHz, higher than common atomic force microscopy probes. With further miniaturization, the resonant frequency of the nanoscale cantilever can be even higher and it may enable higher scanning speed.

An extensive forensic investigation exonerated the primary mirror and the science instruments before pointing to the mechanical interface between the telescope and the spherical aberration corrector, the complex optical subassembly which corrects the spherical aberration introduced by the 11-m primary mirror. Having diagnosed the problem, a detailed repair plan was formulated and implemented when the corrector was removed from the telescope in April 2009. The problematic interface was replaced, and the four aspheric mirrors were optically tested and re-aligned. Individual mirror surface figures were confirmed to meet specification, and a full system test after the re-alignment yielded a root mean square wavefront error of 0.15 waves. The corrector was reinstalled in August 2010 and aligned with respect to the payload and primary mirror. Subsequent on-sky tests revealed spurious signals being sent to the tracker by the auto-collimator, the instrument that maintains the alignment of the corrector with respect to the primary mirror. After rectifying this minor issue, the telescope yielded uniform 1.1 arcsec star images over the full 10-arcmin field of view. © 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","aspheric mirrors; astigmatism; image quality; optical aberrations; optomechanics; Southern African Large Telescope; spherical aberration corrector","Aspheric mirrors; astigmatism; Opto-mechanics; Southern African Large Telescopes; Spherical aberration correctors; Aberrations; Alignment; Aspherics; Image quality; Mirrors; Repair; Telescopes; Optical testing"

The fast response process is purported to be due to elongation of the material as molecules change between cis and trans isomers. In our work, UV light of 350nm will be used to investigate trans to cis isomerization, which should induce contraction. Short fiber segments in a three-contactpoint geometry will be used to control the position and tilt of silver- or aluminum-coated coverslips that together with microscope glass slides as the substrate make optically-actuated beam-controlling mounts and Fabry-Perot interferometers. A Michelson interferometer is used to measure the length change of the fiber actuator.

However, the optical quality of thermoplastics are much better, enabling the cascading of devices in series.

The main advantage of using adhesives is the excellent strength to weight ratio. Adhesive bonding is seen as a desirable joining technique as it allows for greater flexibility in design. A disadvantage of adhesives however is the limited dimensional stability and loadability. To design stable optical mounts, accurate prediction of stresses and deformation is therefore needed. Adhesives show strong temperature and loading history dependent behavior. Viscoelastic material models are needed for accurate prediction of stresses and strains in bonded joints. However, representative material data for adhesives is difficult to find. In this research, an experimental framework is build up to determine relevant mechanical properties of adhesives for improving stress and deformation prediction. This paper shows the results of the characterization experiments and modeling techniques. Also the implementation of material models in finite element code is briefly discussed.

Results are presented for a planar dielectric of arbitrary refractive index placed in an otherwise empty space and moving parallel and perpendicular to the slab-vacuum interface. In both regimes of motion the resulting force comprises lateral and normal velocity-dependent components, which may depend in a subtle way on the Doppler effect and s-p-polarization mixing. For lateral displacements in particular, polarization mixing, which is here interpreted as an effective magnetoelectric effect due to the reduced symmetry induced by the motion of the slab, gives rise to a velocity-dependent force contribution that is sensitive to the phase difference between the two polarization amplitudes. This term gives rise to a rather peculiar optical response on the moving body, and specific cases are illustrated for incident radiation of arbitrarily directed linear polarization.

It has been shown that square and honeycomb lattices are the most suitable to produce simultaneous photonic and phononic band gaps on suspended silicon slabs. The introduction of line defects on such ""phoxonic"" (or optomechanical) crystals should lead to an enhanced interaction between confined light and sound. In this work we report on the experimental measurements of light guiding through waveguides created in these kinds of two-dimensional photonic crystal membranes. The dimensions of the fabricated structures are chosen to provide a ""phoxonic"" bandgap with a photonic gap around 1550 nm. For both kinds of lattice, we observe a hightransmission band when introducing a linear defect, although it is observed for TM polarization in the honeycomb lattice and for TE in the square. Using the plane-wave expansion and the finite element methods we demonstrate that the guided modes are below the light line and, therefore, without additional losses beside fabrication imperfections. Our results lead us to conclude that waveguides implemented in honeycomb and square lattice ""phoxonic"" crystals are a very suitable platform to observe an enhanced interaction between propagating photons and phonons. © 2012 SPIE.","Acousto-optical interactions; Optomechanics; Phonon; Photonic crystal membranes; Silicon-on-insulator","1550 nm; Acousto-optical interaction; Experimental measurements; Fabricated structures; Fabrication imperfections; Guided modes; Honeycomb lattices; Light guiding; Light lines; Line defects; Linear defect; Optical waves; Opto-mechanics; Optomechanical; Phononic band gaps; Photonic crystal membranes; Photonic gaps; Plane-wave expansions; Silicon on insulator; Silicon photonic crystals; Silicon slabs; Square lattices; Square-lattice; Submicron; TM polarization; Two-dimensional photonic crystals; Wave-guiding; Crystal defects; Energy gap; Finite element method; Light; Phonons; Photonic crystals; Waveguides; Honeycomb structures"

One of their key uses is in precision sensing and spectroscopy, where high-performance coatings bridge a broad spectrum of applications from large-scale gravitational wave interferometers (see Chapter 14) to atomic optical clocks (see Chapter 15). Radiation pressure forces inside of such cavities, i.e. the momentum transfer of photons onto the cavity boundaries, impose a fundamental limit on their performance, the so-called standard quantum limit (see Section 1.4), when combined with unavoidable quantum fluctuations in a laser beam. Another limitation arises from random phase fluctuations that are induced by the thermal noise of the coating's mechanical motion (see Chapter 3). With the improved performance of optical coatings, optical cavities are gradually becoming sensitive enough to observe these optomechanical effects. Curiously, what is being considered a nuisance by some fields of research has led within only a few years to the development of a completely new field of optical physics – cavity optomechanics – that exploits optomechanical interactions in high-finesse optical cavities as a new interface between light and matter. A common goal in this field is to exploit the quantum regime of mechanical devices through quantum optical control. This work has immediate implications with respect to fundamental questions, such as the quantum-classical transition of massive objects, and new applications including quantum limited mechanical sensors or mechanical interfaces for quantum information processing. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,

Temperature changes cause materials to expand and contract causing deformations of optical components. The resulting stress states in transmissive optics can cause refractive changes that can affect optical performance. In addition, the temperature changes themselves can cause changes in the refractive properties of transmissive optics. Complex distributions of refractive indices that relate to the thermal profile, the thermo-optic refractive index profile, within the optical media can be predicted by the finite element method. One current technique for representing such refractive index profiles is through the generation of OPD maps by integration along integration paths. While computationally efficient, this method has limitations in its ability to represent the effect of the index changes for rays associated with multiple field points and multiple wavelengths. A more complete representation of the thermo-optic refractive index profile may be passed to the optical analysis software through the use of a user defined gradient index material. The interface consists of a dynamic link library (DLL) which supplies indices of refraction to a user defined gradient index lens as ray tracing calculations are being performed. The DLL obtains its refractive index description from a database derived from the thermal analysis of the optics. This process allows optical analysis software to perform accurate ray tracing for an arbitrary refractive index profile induced by changes in temperature. The implementation of this method by the authors is currently in development as a feature in Sigmadyne/SigFit, and this paper is a current status of that effort. © 2011 SPIE.","Dn/dT; FEA; Integrated analysis; Optomechanics; Thermo-optic","Arbitrary refractive index; Computationally efficient; Current status; Dn/dT; Dynamic link library; Field points; Gradient index lens; Gradient indexes; Integrated analysis; Integration path; Multiple wavelengths; Optical analysis; Optical components; Optical media; Optical performance; Optomechanics; Performance metrics; Physical phenomena; Ray tracing calculations; Refractive change; Refractive index profiles; Refractive properties; Stress state; Temperature changes; Thermal profiles; Thermooptics; Forecasting; Integration; Light refraction; Models; Optical systems; Optics; Refraction; Refractive index; Refractometers; Single mode fibers; Thermoanalysis; Finite element method"

The standard situation studied in most optomechanics experiments pictures the scenario of a Fabry-Perot cavity's end mirror light enough to undergo the mechanical force induced by photons bouncing back on the mirror. Here we are interested in scenarios where the photons are, at least partially, absorbed. As a result of the end mirror absorption, a photothermal force can be produced which can overcome radiation pressure by several orders of magnitude in experimental settings.

Over the course of the next 40 years, the techniques of optical trapping and manipulation have stimulated revolutionary developments: atom interferometry, quantum simulations of condensed matter systems with ultracold gases, the implementation of quantum gates for quantum computation purposes. More recently, the possibility to apply the techniques of optical cooling and manipulation to the mechanical degree of freedom of larger objects has established a very active research field - cavity quantum optomechanics. Future applications range from ultra-high sensitivity detectors of mass- or force and quantum transducers for quantum computation purposes, to their potential of being an ideal testbed for the investigation of fundamental aspects of quantum. A potential improvement to better isolated system is the use optically leviting nanodielectrics as a cavity quantum optomechanical system. This consists in optically trapping a nanodielectric by means of optical tweezers inside a high finesse optical cavity. More recently, both theoretical and experimental research along this direction has been reported. It can thus be foreseen that a new generation of exciting experiments, aiming at bringing levitating dielectrics into the quantum regime, will eventually take place in the near future. Indeed, from a broad perspective, this project aims at extending the techniques developed during the last decades of optical cooling and manipulation of atoms (e.g. like in cavity QED with single atoms and molecules), back to the nanodielectrics that were first used in the times of birth of optical trapping. This experimental challenge, if successful, would allow to test quantum mechanics at unprecedented scales. In this talk I will review the field of quantum optomechanics and I will particularly focus on the proposal of using optically levitating dielectrics. I will concentrate on its state-of-art and future applications.

Here we suggest a novel approach to light storage involving an optical waveguide coupled to an optomechanical crystal array, where light in the waveguide can be dynamically and reversibly mapped into long-lived mechanical vibrations in the array. This technique enables large bandwidths and long storage and delay times in a compact, on-chip platform. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.","Nanomechanics; Optomechanics; Slow light",

At the nano-scale, the optomechanical coupling increases further thanks to a smaller optomechanical interaction volume and reduced mass of the mechanical oscillator. In view of realizing such cavity nanooptomechanics experiments, a scheme was proposed where a sub-wavelength sized nanomechanical oscillator is coupled to a high finesse optical microcavity.3 Here we present such an experiment involving a single nanomechanical rod precisely positioned into the confined mode of a miniature Fabry-Pérot cavity.4 We describe the employed stabilized cavity set-up and related finesse measurements. We proceed characterizing the nanorod vibration properties using ultrasonic piezo-actuation methods. Using the optical cavity as a transducer of nanomechanical motion, we monitor optically the piezo-driven nanorod vibration. On top of extending cavity quantum electrodynamics concepts to nanomechanical systems, cavity nano-optomechanics should advance into precision displacement measurements near the standard quantum limit5, investigation of mechanical systems in their quantum regime, non-linear dynamics6 and sensing applications. © 2010 SPIE.","Cavity optomechanics; Fiber optics; Micro-cavity; Nanomechanics; Optical sensing","Actuation methods; Cavity optomechanics; Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics; Confined modes; Mechanical oscillators; Mechanical systems; Movable walls; Nano scale; Nanomechanical motion; Nanomechanical oscillators; Nanomechanical systems; Non-linear; Optical cavities; Optical microcavities; Optical sensing; Opto-mechanics; Optomechanical; Precision displacement; Quantum regimes; Sensing applications; Sub-wavelength; Vibration properties; Electrodynamics; Microcavities; Nanomechanics; Nanorods; Oscillators (electronic); Oscillators (mechanical); Photons; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Light"

Observing modes include direct imaging, spectroscopy, Fabry-Perot interferometry and polarimetry. This contribution focuses on the optomechanics and detector controller description of CATAVIÑA, which is planned to start operating later in 2006. The camera consists of an 8 inch LN2 dewar containing a 10 filter carousel, a radiation baffle and the detector circuit board mount. The system is based on a Rockwell 1024×1024 HgCdTe (HAWAII-I) FPA, operating in the 1 to 2.5 micron window. The detector controller/readout system was designed and developed at UNAM Instituto de Astronomía. It is based on five Texas Instruments DSK digital signal processor (DSP) modules. One module generates the detector and ADC-system control, while the remaining four are in charge of the acquisition of each of the detector's quadrants. Each DSP has a built-in expanded memory module in order to store more than one image. The detector read-out and signal driver subsystems are mounted onto the dewar in a ""back-pack"" fashion, each containing four independent pre-amplifiers, converters and signal drivers, that communicate through fiber optics with their respective DSPs. This system has the possibility of programming the offset input voltage and converter gain. The controller software architecture is based on a client/server model. The client sends commands through the TCP/IP protocol and acquires the image. The server consists of a microcomputer with an embedded Linux operating system, which runs the main program that receives the user commands and interacts with the timing and acquisition DSPs. The observer's interface allows for several readout and image processing modes.","Infrared Instrumentation; Near-Infrared Camera","Embedded Linux operating system; Infrared Instrumentation; Near-Infrared Camera; Software architecture; Cameras; Computer operating systems; Computer software; Fabry-Perot interferometers; Infrared imaging; Network protocols; Polarimeters; User interfaces; Infrared devices"

This technique enables in-process real-time measurements, as well as quick off-line measurements. Optical system of ELD is designed to measure the light scattering patterns of fibers regardless of their locations and orientations. This feature has enabled for the first time to collectively measure the streams of fibers emerging from a spinner head like a meltblowing die. The present paper reports the recent enhancements to the ELD technique and shows how they are helping with the advanced diagnostics of nonwovens. The smallest fiber size measured by ELD is limited by the wavelength of the laser used for the measurement. Previous technology employed a red laser diode (wavelength: 635nm), which resulted in a minimum measurable fiber size of 2.5 μm. A violet (405nm) laser diode has been recently incorporated into the system. The shorter wavelength of this laser source allows for sizing of fibers down to about 1 μm in mean size. It also improves the measurement accuracy for fibers between 2.5 and 5 μm. This size range is common in both meltblown polymer fibers and glass fibers. This new system will allow for wider use of the ELD technology by industry. A second improvement to the system has been the innovative redesign of the optomechanics to collect scattered light from fibers across a larger spatial region. In the previous design, fibers had to be located within ∼75 mm of the receiving head in order to accurately size them. The new optics allow for accurate sizing out to 150 mm. Further, new algorithms are developed to measure fibers as far away as 500 mm from the receiver, provided that the mean size is larger than 4.5 μm. This is a significant improvement for many on-line applications of nonwoven fibers. Finally, this paper reports measurements of fiber structure and morphology in addition to the size distribution. The light scattering pattern measured by the ensemble laser diffraction technique contains information about the radial refractive index profile in the fiber which evolves with the solidification of the fibers. Hence, information about solidification of the fibers in online applications is obtained. Similarly, certain characteristics of the scattering pattern reveal information about formation of crystals within the fibers. Online data are used to show the capability of ensemble diffraction in measuring the fiber structure and morphology.",,"Ensemble laser diffraction (ELD); Meltblown polymers; Diffraction; Semiconductor lasers; Solidification; Nonwoven fabrics; Diffraction; Lasers; Nonwovens; Solidification"

The sequence is divided into five phases: specification, optics design, optomechanical design, manufacturing and characterization. During specification, the optical and mechanical requirements of the lens are defined. In the optical design phase, the lens is optimized, and a tolerance analysis is carried out. Simulation tools, especially, an image quality simulator, can be used to visualize and verify the performance of the design. Mechanical design is performed considering the geometrical specifications and optical tolerances of the system. In addition, stray light analysis is carried out to verify the optical performance of the optomechanics. Plastic optics are particularly vulnerable to stray light due to the integrated mountings, which provide additional paths for unwanted light. If the prototype is used for preliminary performance evaluation of a future product, the differences between prototype and mass manufacturing methods need to be considered carefully. After the lenses are manufactured they are characterized, and the experimental results are compared with the original specifications and estimations obtained from the previous design verification simulations. New error analysis simulations can be performed in order to pinpoint faults in manufactured modules. If the performance of the prototype is not sufficient, a new prototyping iteration circle is needed. The whole process is described and analyzed using a miniature, plastic imaging lens as an example, but it can also be applied to other optical prototyping tasks.","Concurrent engineering; Imaging lens; Optical engineering; Plastic optics; Prototyping","Computer simulation; Computer software; Concurrent engineering; Decision making; Image quality; Imaging systems; Monte Carlo methods; Optical design; Optical engineering; Optimization; Software prototyping; Imaging lens; Plastic optics; Plastic lenses"

The intent of this effort was to begin identifying significant factors for bonding small mirrors for high stability. A screening experiment was performed in which half-inch diameter flat mirrors were face bonded to similar mirror mounts, then bolted to a reference test fixture and subjected to an environmental temperature range of-40 to +70 °C. Mount material, optic material, adhesive material, bond joint design, and bond thickness were varied. The resulting tilt errors in the mirror assemblies were measured. Steps were taken to isolate the bond joint stability as opposed to stability in the mounted mirror subassemblies. The effort required to minimize experimental noise was much greater than anticipated. This first experimental effort failed to identify main factors with statistical significance, however; some results are interesting. Perhaps also of interest is the progress made at characterizing the experimental setup and process, and lessons learned in control of noise factors in this kind of experiment. © 2001 SPIE · 0277-786X/01/$15.00.","Bonding; Boresight; Mount; Mounting; Optomechanical; Stability; Testing; Thermal","Glass bonding; Laser optics; Mountings; Optical beam splitters; Optical instrument lenses; Optical radar; Plastic adhesives; Range finders; Thermal effects; Optomechanics; Mirrors"

Small misalignments of the components can substantially decrease the coupling efficiency between the source and detector.

We show that in the Bogoliubov approximation, due to the large number of photons in the condensate, there is a linear strong effective coupling between the Bogoliubov mode of the photonic Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) and the mechanical motion of the membrane which depends on the photon–photon scattering potential. This coupling leads to the cooling of the mechanical motion, the normal mode splitting (NMS), the squeezing of the output field and the entanglement between the excited mode of the cavity and the mechanical mode. Since the photon condensation occurs at room temperature, this hybrid system can be potentially considered as a room temperature source of squeezed light as well as a suited candidate for exploring the quantum effects. We show that, on one hand, the non-linearity of the photon gas increases the degree of the squeezing of the output field of the microcavity and the efficiency of the cooling process at high temperatures. On the other hand, it reduces the NMS in the displacement spectrum of the oscillating membrane and the degree of the optomechanical entanglement. In addition, the temperature of the photonic BEC can be used to control the above-mentioned phenomena. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","cavity optomechanics; field squeezing; ground state cooling; optomechanical entanglement; Photonic Bose–Einstein condensate","Cooling; Ground state; Hybrid systems; Microcavities; Quantum electronics; Quantum entanglement; Quantum theory; Cavity optomechanics; Einstein condensate; field squeezing; Ground state cooling; Optomechanical entanglements; Photons"

The confined cold atoms are driven with two external classical fields and an internal cavity field. The internal cavity field is excited by an external driving field and shows a radiation pressure upon the movable end mirror. The coupling of atom-light and opto-mechanical interactions is enhanced by embedding a four-level atomic system in a typical opto-mechanical cavity.

Our treatment is intuitive to use, provides fresh analytical insight into the physics of the Raman scattering near metallic surfaces, and can be applied to a wide range of geometries including resonators, waveguides, and hybrid photonic-plasmonic systems. Our general theory demonstrates that the detected Raman spectrum originates from an interplay between nonlinear light generation and propagation (which also includes the effects of optical quenching). Counterintuitively, at the nonlinear generation stage, we show that the Stokes (anti-Stokes) signal at the molecule location depends on the plasmonic enhancements, through the projected local density of photon states (LDOS), at the anti-Stokes (Stokes) frequency. However, when propagating from the vibrating molecule to the far field, the Stokes (anti-Stokes) emission experiences a plasmonic enhancement at the Stokes (anti-Stokes) frequency, as expected. We identify the limits of the commonly known E4 electric-field rule for Raman signal enhancement near plasmonic surfaces at low pump powers, as well as a different E8 rule at high pump powers, and we clarify the role of the LDOS. Our theory uses a generalized quantum master equation where the plasmonic system is treated as an environmental bath that is described through the photonic Green function of the medium. Therefore, any classical electrodynamics-related physics, such as quenching and propagation, are self-consistently included in the model. The presented formalism is also capable of describing the full spatial Raman response in a simple analytical way. This spatial analysis includes both the dependency of the Raman signals at a fixed detector location when the molecule is moved around the plasmonic platform and the dependency of the Raman signal on the detector location. We demonstrate the power of this approach by using a quasinormal mode expansion theory of localized plasmons to construct the photonic Green functions of the plasmonic resonators and explore several different nanoresonator systems. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","molecules; optomechanics; plasmonics; quantum optics; spectrum; surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy","Electric fields; Fixed platforms; Light transmission; Location; Molecules; Nonlinear optics; Quantum optics; Quenching; Raman scattering; Raman spectroscopy; Resonators; Signal detection; Classical electrodynamics; Nanoresonator systems; Opto-mechanics; Plasmonics; Quantum master equations; spectrum; Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy; Surface-enhanced Raman spectrum; Plasmons"

In order to quantify entanglement we use the logarithmic negativity. The analytical solutions are presented for the system in a parameter regime very close to the current experimental results. We show that in the presence of the photon hopping process between the cavities, the two mechanical resonators and the field modes can be entangled.

In this paper, we propose a scheme for examining dynamical Gaussian quantum steering of two mixed mechanical modes. For this, we use two spatially separated optomechanical cavities fed by squeezed light. We work in the resolved sideband regime. Limiting to the adiabatic regime, we show that it is possible to generate dynamical Gaussian steering via a quantum fluctuations transfer from squeezed light to the mechanical modes. By an appropriate choice of the environmental parameters, one-way steering can be observed in different scenarios. Finally, comparing with entanglement – quantified by the Gaussian Rényi-2 entropy, we show that Gaussian steering is strongly sensitive to the thermal effects and always upper bounded by entanglement degree.

Whereas gold is the most-studied plasmonic material, aluminum has the advantage of high earth abundance and hence low cost. In addition to understanding the size and shape tunability of the plasmon resonance, the fundamental relaxation processes in aluminum nanostructures after photoexcitation must be understood to take full advantage of applications such as photocatalysis and photodetection. In this work, we investigate the relaxation following ultrafast pulsed excitation and the launching of acoustic vibrations in individual aluminum nanodisks, using single-particle transient extinction spectroscopy. We find that the transient extinction signal can be assigned to a thermal relaxation of the photoexcited electrons and phonons. The ultrafast heating-induced launching of in-plane acoustic vibrations reveals moderate binding to the glass substrate and is affected by the native aluminum oxide layer. Finally, we compare the behavior of aluminum nanodisks to that of similarly prepared and sized gold nanodisks. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","Acoustic vibrations; aluminum nanostructures; nanomechanics; single-particle spectroscopy; ultrafast spectroscopy","Acoustic spectroscopy; Gold; Nanomechanics; Nanostructures; Plasmons; Substrates; Surface plasmon resonance; Acoustic vibration; Gold Nanoparticles; Photoexcited electrons; Plasmon resonances; Single particle spectroscopy; Thermal relaxation; Transient extinction; Ultra-fast spectroscopies; Aluminum"

Here, we solve the problem of nanoparticle diffusion in a bounded domain in the presence of an exponentially decaying driving force, which can represent a chiral force exerted on nanoparticle enantiomers by a circularly polarized light beam exhibiting either scattering, absorption, or both. We analyze the steady state spatial distributions of two basic purity measures of chiral mixtures, showing that extinction puts a fundamental limit on the degree of enantiopurification achievable with optical forces.

This metamaterial is unique in the sense that its responses to uniaxial forcing can be tailored by programmed laser inputs to manifest different nonlinear constitutive behaviors, such as monotonic, S-shape, plateau, and non-monotonic snapping performance. To demonstrate the novel metamaterial, a thin sheet of soft material impinged by two counterpropagating lasers along its thickness direction and stretched by an in-plane tensile mechanical force is considered. A theoretical model is formulated to characterize the resulting optomechanical behavior of the thin sheet by combining the nonlinear elasticity theory of soft materials and the optical radiation stress theory. The optical radiation stresses predicted by the proposed model are validated by simulations based on the method of finite elements. Programmed optomechanical behaviors are subsequently explored using the validated model under different initial sheet thicknesses and different optical inputs, and the first- and second-order tangential stiffness of the metamaterial are used to plot the phase diagram of its nonlinear constitutive behaviors. The proposed optomechanical soft metamaterial shows great potential in biological medicine, microfluidic manipulation, and other fields. © 2017 The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics; Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Optical radiation stress; Optomechanics; Programmable constitutive relation; Soft metamaterial","Elasticity; Finite element method; Metamaterials; Constitutive relations; Method of finite elements; Nonlinear constitutive behavior; Nonlinear elasticity theory; Optical radiations; Opto-mechanics; Tangential stiffness; Theoretical modeling; Nonlinear optics"

These precision applications require exquisite control. Here, we present full control over the rotational and translational dynamics of an optically levitated silicon nanorod. We trap its center-of-mass and align it along the linear polarization of the laser field. The rod can be set into rotation at a predefined frequency by exploiting the radiation pressure exerted by elliptically polarized light. The rotational motion of the rod dynamically modifies the optical potential, which allows tuning of the rotational frequency over hundreds of kilohertz. Through nanofabrication, we can tailor all of the trapping frequencies and the optical torque, achieving reproducible dynamics that are stable over months, and analytically predict the motion with great accuracy.

The most prevalent paradigm for the design and employment of multi-core fibers relies on the suppression of direct coupling of optical power among cores. The cores, however, remain mechanically coupled. Intercore, opto-mechanical cross-talk, among cores that are otherwise optically isolated from one another, is shown in this work for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Light in one core stimulates guided acoustic modes of the entire fiber cladding. These modes, in turn, induce refractive index perturbations that extend across to other cores. Unlike corresponding processes in standard fiber, light waves in off-axis cores stimulate general torsional-radial guided acoustic modes of the cylindrical cross section. Hundreds of such modes give rise to inter-core cross-phase modulation, with broad spectra that are quasi-continuous up to 1 GHz frequency. Inter-core cross-talk in a commercial, seven-core fiber is studied in both analysis and experiment. Opto-mechanical cross-talk is quantified in terms of an equivalent nonlinear coefficient, per acoustic mode or per frequency. The nonlinear coefficient may reach 1.9[W× km]-1, a value that is comparable with that of the intra-core Kerr effect in the same fiber. © 2017 Optical Society of America.","Brillouin; Fibers; Nonlinear optics; Optomechanics; Scattering",

The time modulation of the driving field leads to the parametric amplification of the mechanical vacuum fluctuations of the MO, which results in the generation of Casimir phonons over time scales longer than the cavity lifetime. We show that the generated phonons exhibit quadrature squeezing, bunching effect, and super-Poissonian statistics, which are controllable by the externally modulated laser pump. In particular, we find that the scheme enables a perfect squeezing transfer from one mechanical quadrature to another when the laser frequency is varied from red detuning to blue detuning. Moreover, by analyzing the effect of the thermal noise of the MO environment, we find that there exists a critical temperature above which no phonon quadrature squeezing occurs. We also show that in the presence of time modulation of the driving laser, the linewidth narrowing of the displacement spectrum of the MO can be considered a signature of the generation of Casimir phonons. © 2017 Optical Society of America.",,"Fabry-Perot interferometers; Ground state; Modulation; Optical parametric amplifiers; Oscillistors; Pumping (laser); Quantum theory; Cavity optomechanics; Critical temperatures; Dynamical Casimir effect; Externally modulated lasers; Mechanical oscillators; Mechanical quadratures; Parametric amplification; Poissonian statistics; Phonons"

In spite of the electromechanical resonators being spatially distinct, they can still be strongly dynamically coupled via a classical analogue of the beam splitter interaction with a cooperativity exceeding five, and parametric down-conversion which results in both resonators self-oscillating. This latter regime yields a classical variant of a two-mode squeezed state which is identified as perfectly correlated phase-locked vibrations between the two resonators. The creation of a correlation between two separate mechanical resonators suggests that extending this interaction to vacuum phonon states could enable a macroscopic two-mode squeezed state to be generated. Conversely, the ability to resolve the correlated state via the self-oscillations could be harnessed to build a new class of detector where an external stimulus neutralises the phase-locked vibrations. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.","NEMS/MEMS; optomechanics; parametric down-conversion; self-oscillations; two-mode squeezing","Locks (fasteners); Phonons; Quantum optics; Resonance; Resonators; NEMS/MEMS; Opto-mechanics; Parametric down conversion; Self-oscillations; Two-mode squeezing; Electromechanical devices"

It is proposed here to solve the problem by trapping a composite particle (a nanodiamond core coated with a less absorptive silica shell) at the center of strongly focused doughnut-shaped laser beams. Systematical study on the trapping stability, heat absorption, and oscillation frequency concludes that the azimuthally polarized Gaussian beam and the linearly polarized Laguerre-Gaussian beam LG03 are the optimal choices.

The cavity mode is depicted as a probe field, and a classical driving field is applied to the atomic medium as the control laser in each system. Interaction between the cavity mode, atomic media and the oscillating mirror of the cavity can change the susceptibility of the atomic ensemble. Equations of motion demonstrate a system of nonlinear equations for each system. Nonlinearity of equations is a result of interaction between the cavity mode and atomic transitions. The equations are solved via a perturbation method. The results show two different aspects of atom-assisted optomechanics in V-type system: a common transparency window and an amplifying process in a transparency window that does not occur in the Λ configuration, notable as a considerable difference between the proposed systems. It is shown that classical field detuning leads to different changes in the susceptibility of both systems; other values of cavity detuning, except in the resonant case, can guarantee the occurrence of EIT in the system. For the initial value of the cavity field, a negative region appears in absorption spectrum of the V-type atomic ensemble. Meanwhile, the Λ configuration does not show a such process.

Such hybrid devices create exciting opportunities to mediate interactions between disparate quantum bits (qubits) and to explore the quantum regime of macroscopic mechanical objects. In particular, a system consisting of the nitrogen-vacancy defect center (NV center) in diamond coupled to a high-quality-factor mechanical oscillator is an appealing candidate for such a hybrid quantum device, as it utilizes the highly coherent and versatile spin properties of the defect center. In this paper, we will review recent experimental progress on diamond-based hybrid quantum devices in which the spin and orbital dynamics of single defects are driven by the motion of a mechanical oscillator.

Breaking this transmission symmetry offers enhanced control over signal transport, isolation and source protection. So far, devices that break reciprocity (and therefore show non-reciprocity) have been mostly considered in dynamic systems involving electromagnetic, acoustic and mechanical wave propagation associated with fields varying in space and time. Here we show that it is possible to break reciprocity in static systems, realizing mechanical metamaterials that exhibit vastly different output displacements under excitation from different sides, as well as one-way displacement amplification. This is achieved by combining large nonlinearities with suitable geometrical asymmetries and/or topological features. In addition to extending non-reciprocity and isolation to statics, our work sheds light on energy propagation in nonlinear materials with asymmetric crystalline structures and topological properties. We anticipate that breaking reciprocity will open avenues for energy absorption, conversion and harvesting, soft robotics, prosthetics and optomechanics.",,

With our scheme, the optical out-coupling and intrinsic loss are measured independently while any perturbation induced by thermal, acoustic and laser-frequency noise is avoided thanks to the ultra-short light-cavity interaction time.

In this paper, we propose a scheme for enhanced high-order sideband generation (HSG) and clear carrier-envelope phase-dependent (CEP) effects in a three-mode cavity optomechanical system, where two optical cavity modes are coupled to a common mechanical resonator. In the present scheme, the left cavity mode is coherently pumped by a continuous-wave (CW) control field and an intense nanosecond signal pulse, and the cavity output via the loss channel is monitored. The right cavity mode is only pumped by a CW driving field. Via numerical simulations, we show that when the right pump is turned off, the effect of HSG can be observed in the output spectrum of the left cavity mode in the non-perturbative regime. However, when the right cavity mode is pumped at its blue sideband, enhanced HSG can be achieved and a clear CEP effect can be observed in the generated high-order sideband spectra. This study may provide the further insight of the HSG and CEP effects in cavity optomechanics in the nonlinear and non-perturbative regime, and may find potential applications in the areas of optical communications and quantum information processing. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH","Carrier-envelope phase-dependent effect; High-order sideband generation; Non-perturbative regime; Three-mode cavity optomechanics","Cavity resonators; Optical communication; Quantum optics; Carrier-envelope phase; Cavity optomechanics; High-order; Mechanical resonators; Non-perturbative regime; Opto-mechanical systems; Quantum-information processing; Radiation pressure; Optical pumping"

The photons can be well confined in the slot owing to the large electric field discontinuity at the air/dielectric interfaces. Besides, the surface acoustic modes lead to the localization of the phonons near the air-slot. The high overlap of the photonic and phononic cavity modes near the slot results in a significant enhancement of the moving interface effect, and thus strengthens the total acousto-optical interaction.

This feature opens new horizons in low power observation of physical phenomena such as lasing, sensing and radiation pressure driven oscillations. Radiation pressure instability facilitates transfer of energy from photons to mechanical degree of freedom in optical resonators. In high quality toroidal micro cavities, radiation pressure is demonstrated in the form of «dynamic back action» and results mechanical oscillations with sub-Hz linewidth. Since the toroidal cavities are symmetrical in nature, the exerted radiation pressure can mainly excite radially symmetric modes such as the first cantilever mode and the radially breathing mode. Study of these modes reveals important information about interaction of light and mechanical mode as well as intrinsic properties of the resonator as a mechanical oscillator. However, there are some unexcited mechanical modes that in some cases have even higher mechanical quality factors compared to the usually excited ones. Most of the properties of these mechanical modes remain unknown because the radially symmetric force does not provide a component to excite them. In this research, we have developed a novel method to fabricate asymmetric toroidal resonators (minor and major diameters), which enables us to regeneratively excite unobserved asymmetric modes.

Consequently, the transport of mass density and the related kinetic and elastic energies of atoms is neglected. We have recently presented foundations of a covariant theory of light propagation in a medium by considering a light wave simultaneously with the dynamics of the medium atoms driven by optoelastic forces between the induced dipoles and the electromagnetic field. In the previously discussed mass-polariton (MP) quasiparticle approach, we considered the light pulse as an isolated coupled state between the photon and matter and showed that the momentum and the transferred mass of MP follow unambiguously from the Lorentz invariance and the fundamental conservation laws of nature. In the present work, we combine the electrodynamics of continuous media and elasticity theory to account for the space and time dependent dynamics of the light pulse and the associated mass and momentum distributions of the mass density wave (MDW). In this optoelastic continuum dynamics (OCD) approach, we obtain a numerically accurate solution of the Newtonian continuum dynamics of the medium when the light pulse is propagating in it. For an incoming Gaussian light pulse having total energy E0 in vacuum, the OCD simulations of the light pulse propagating in a crystal having refractive index n give the same momentum p = nE0/c and the transferred mass δm = (n2-1)E0/c2 as the MP quasiparticle approach. Since the elastic forces are included in our theory on equal footing with the optical forces, our theory also predicts how the mass and thermal equilibria are re-established by elastic waves. © 2017 SPIE.","electrodynamics; mass-polariton; optical forces; optomechanics; photon momentum","Dynamics; Elastic waves; Elasticity; Electrodynamics; Electromagnetic field theory; Electromagnetic fields; Electromagnetic waves; Gaussian beams; Light propagation; Light transmission; Momentum; Optoelectronic devices; Phonons; Photons; Quantum theory; Refractive index; Light pulse propagating; Momentum distributions; Optical force; Opto-mechanics; Photon momentum; Polaritons; Quasi-particle approach; Thermal-equilibrium; Light"

We solve the quantum dynamics of an optomechanical system in the multiphoton strong-coupling regime retaining nonlinear terms. This is achieved by performing a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation on the Hamiltonian including driving terms. The approach is valid away from the red- and blue-sideband drive. We show that the mechanical resonator displays self-sustained oscillations in regimes where the linear model predicts instabilities and that the amplitude of these oscillations is limited by the nonlinear terms. Related oscillations of the photon number are present due to frequency mixing of the shifted mechanical and cavity frequencies. This leads to additional peaks in the cavity's spectral density.

The photon-hopping coupling of the cavities gives rise to two cavity supermodes whose resonant frequencies can be obtained in the probe transmission spectrum. In a strong photon-hopping coupling regime, there is a large coupling rate between the probe field and one of the two cavity supermodes that is called a bright mode. The optomechanical couplings between the bright mode and two mechanical resonators can cause double optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT), which can be employed to both separately and simultaneously store two weak probe pulses with different central frequencies.

Here we describe the GaAs/AlAs semiconductor microcavity as a device that, depending on the excitation conditions, either confines or slows down both light and optically generated acoustic phonons. The localization of photons and phonons in the same place of space amplifies optomechanical processes. Picosecond laser pulses are used to study through time-resolved reflectivity experiments the coupling between photons and both confined and slow acoustic phonons when the laser is tuned either with the cavity (confined) optical mode or with the stop-band edge (slow) optical modes. A model that fully takes into account the modified propagation of the acoustic phonons and light in these resonant structures is used to describe the laser detuning dependence of the coherently generated phonon spectra and amplitude under these different modes of laser excitation. We observe that confined light couples only to confined mechanical vibrations, while slow light can generate both confined and slow coherent vibrations. A strong enhancement of the optomechanical coupling using confined photons and vibrations, and also with properly designed slow photon and phonon modes, is demonstrated. The prospects for the use of these optoelectronic devices in confined and slow optomechanics are addressed. © 2016 American Physical Society.",,

To overcome this problem and improve detector performances, we propose novel approaches in which concepts borrowed from high frequency electronics and metamaterials are exploited to realize THz detectors. In particular, we have investigated sub-wavelength metallic antennas and L-C resonators that enable THz detection using two very different schemes: Patch-antennas coupled to microcavities and optomechanical split-ring resonators In the first scheme, we have developed plasmonic antennas that collect photons from the free space and also act as microcavities. The antenna permits to gather photons from a much larger area than that of the pixel, while the microcavities effect increases its quantum efficiency. With these devices we were able to increase the temperature of operation above 20K of very sensitive THz detectors. The second detection scheme is an entirely new approach that combines concepts of circuit electronics and optomechanics. The detector is a high frequency electronic resonator (split ring resonator at 2.5 THz) realized with a flexible arm that acts as a cantilever. Under THz illumination a dynamic distribution of charges with opposite signs appears on both plates of the capacitors (the gap of the split ring resonator). This results in a quasi-static Coulomb force that tend to close the gap of the capacitor and sets the cantilever in motion. The amplitude of this mechanical movement is directly related to the intensity of the incident THz wave, and can be read-out optically with sub-picometer precision. By calibrating very accurately the noise properties of the detection scheme, we were able to precisely determine its noise equivalent power, which is on the order of NEP = 500pW/Hz1/2. We believe that the use of subwavelength structures and metamaterials will be extremely beneficial for enhancing the performance of quadratic quantum detector in the THz frequency range. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Antennas; Metamaterials; Microcavities; Microstrip antennas; Nanocantilevers; Optical resonators; Photons; Resonators; Ring gages; Robotic arms; Slot antennas; Detector performance; Dynamic distribution; Electronic transition; High-frequency electronics; Mechanical movements; Noise equivalent power; Split ring resonator; Sub-wavelength structures; Terahertz waves"

It is a promising avenue to solid-state quantum optics and has potential applications in high sensitivity measurement of weak force, tiny displacement and mass, and quantum information science. As a solid-state system of quantum optics, it has many interesting coherent phenomena, such as optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT), which is the optomechanical analog of the well-known phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). However, due to diversity in structure, OMIT systems must have many new phenomena which do not exist in ordinary EIT systems. On the other hand, whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microresonators have been investigated extensively. WGM microresonators have a wide range of applications due to their high quality factors and microscale mode volumes. WGM microresonators can also be used for OMIT systems, which have been investigated extensively. In this paper, we study the coherent control of an double-cavity optomechanical system which is composed of two WGM microresonators. We assume that the two WGM microcavties are driven by two strong control fields and two weak probe fields, and, one of the two cavities can create a macroscopic mechanical breathing mode under the action of a radiation pressure force. We also assume that the two WGM microcavties are directly coupled by an evanescent field. We theoretically study the quantum coherent control of electromagnetically induced transparency in this system, and find that in contrast with ordinary EIT systems, there are many new properties in this OMIT system, for example if two control fields with appropriate amplitudes and detunings are used to drive the system, the probe field, which is input to one of the two cavities, will be completely output from the other cavity, i. e., the perfect transparency of the quantum coherence phenomenon can occur in this system. We also find that the electromagnetically induced transparency can be realized and controlled in this optomechanical system by adjusting the relative intensity and the relative phase between the two input probe fields, and the width and depth of the EIT window are sensitive to the relative intensity of the two control fields, which may be used for switching between fast and slow light. These results indicate important progress toward signal amplification, light storage, fast light, and slow light in quantum information processes. Considering the fact that WGM microresonators are the frontier research subjects ranging from biosensing, nonlinear optics, and laser physics, to fundamental physics such as cavity quantum electrodynamics, we believe that the results in this paper have a wide range of applications. © 2016 Chinese Physical Society.","Cavity optomechanics; Electromagnetically induced transparency; Perfect transparency; Whispering-gallery-mode","Electrodynamics; Evanescent fields; Information science; Light; Nonlinear optics; Optical resonators; Probes; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Resonators; Slow light; Transparency; Cavity optomechanics; Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics; Electromagnetically-induced transparency; High sensitivity measurement; Interdisciplinary research; Optomechanically induced transparencies; Quantum information process; Quantum information science; Whispering gallery modes"

However, it has been shown in experiments on resonators that net phonon annihilation through anti-Stokes Brillouin scattering can be enabled by means of a suitable set of optical and acoustic states. The cooling of traveling phonons in a linear waveguide, on the other hand, could lead to the exciting future prospect of manipulating unidirectional phonon fluxes and even the nonreciprocal transport of quantum information via phonons. In this work, we present an analysis of the conditions under which Brillouin cooling of phonons of both low and high group velocities may be achieved in a linear waveguide. We analyze the three-wave mixing interaction between the optical and traveling acoustic modes that participate in forward Brillouin scattering, and reveal the key regimes of operation for the process. Our calculations indicate that measurable cooling may occur in a system having phonons with spatial loss rate that is of the same order as the spatial optical loss rate.

It was jointly designed and built by the Nanjing Astronomical Instruments Factory (NAIF), Beijing Astronomical Observatory (now National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, NAOC), and Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1989. It is a Ritchey-Chrétien (R-C) reflector on an English equatorial mount and the effective aperture is 2.16 m. It had been the largest optical telescope in China for ∼18 years until the Guoshoujing Telescope (also called Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, LAMOST) and the Lijiang 2.4-m telescope were built. At present, there are three main instruments on the Cassegrain focus available: the Beijing Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (BFOSC) for direct imaging and low-resolution (R ∼ 500-2000) spectroscopy, the spectrograph made by Optomechanics Research Inc. (OMR) for low-resolution spectroscopy (the spectral resolutions are similar to those of BFOSC) and the fiber-fed High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS; R ∼ 30,000-65,000). The telescope is widely open to astronomers all over China as well as international astronomical observers. Each year there are more than 40 ongoing observing projects, including 6-8 key projects. Recently, some new techniques and instruments (e.g., astro-frequency comb calibration system, polarimeter, and adaptive optics) have been or will be tested on the telescope to extend its observing abilities. © 2016.

This paper addresses the design concept for a novel optomechanical device capable of ultrahigh quality factors in the audio frequency band with negligible thermal noise. The proposed system consists of a minimally supported millimeter scale pendulum mounted in a double end-mirror sloshing cavity that is topologically equivalent to a membrane-in-the-middle cavity. The radiation pressure inside the high-finesse cavity allows for high optical stiffness, cancellation of terms which lead to unwanted negative damping and suppression of quantum radiation pressure noise. We solve the optical spring dynamics of the system using the Hamiltonian, find the noise spectral density and show that stable optical trapping is possible. We also assess various loss mechanisms, one of the most important being the acceleration loss due to the optical spring. We show that practical devices, starting from a centre-of-mass pendulum frequency of 0.1 Hz, could achieve a maximum quality factor of (1014) with optical spring stiffened frequency 1-10 kHz. Small resonators of mass 1 g or less could achieve a Q-factor of (1011) at a frequency of 100 kHz.

Our approach is based on the Maxwell wave equation and complements previous studies based on an effective Hamiltonian. The analysis shows that for slowly moving and weakly reflective membranes the classical field dynamics can be approximated by first-order-in-time evolution given by an effective Schrödinger-type equation with a Hamiltonian that does not depend on the membrane speed. This approximate theory is the one typically adopted in cavity optomechanics and we develop a criterion for its validity. However, in more general situations, the full second-order wave equation predicts light dynamics which do not conserve energy, giving rise to parametric amplification (or attenuation) that is forbidden under first-order dynamics and can be considered to be the classical counterpart of the dynamical Casimir effect. The case of a membrane moving at constant velocity can be mapped onto the Landau-Zener problem, but with additional terms responsible for field amplification. Furthermore, the nature of the adiabatic regime is rather different from the ordinary Schrödinger case since mode amplitudes need not be constant even when there are no transitions between them. The Landau-Zener problem for a field is therefore richer than in the standard single-particle case. We use the work-energy theorem applied to the radiation pressure on the membrane as a self-consistency check for our solutions of the wave equation and as a tool to gain an intuitive understanding of energy pumped into or out of the light field by the motion of the membrane. © 2016 American Physical Society.",,"Amplification; Dynamics; Maxwell equations; Membranes; Optical parametric amplifiers; Quantum theory; Wave equations; Classical counterpart; Dielectric membranes; Dynamical Casimir effect; Effective Hamiltonian; Intuitive understanding; Parametric amplification; Second-order wave equations; Theoretical investigations; Hamiltonians"

Cavity optomechanic systems based on WGM cavities have progressed enormously in recent years due to the fact that they reveal and explore fundamental quantum physics and pave the way for potential applications of optomechanical devices. However, WGM based cavity optomechanics still lies in a single optical mode coupled to a single mechanical mode. Here in this paper, in order to reveal more quantum phenomena and realize remarkable applications, we present a typical multimode cavity optomechanical system composed of two WGM cavities, of which one WGM cavity is an optomechanical cavity driven by a pump laser and a probe laser and the other cavity is an ordinary WGM cavity only driven with a pump laser. The two WGM cavities are coupled with each other via exchanging energy, and the coupling strength depends on the distance between the two cavities. With the standard method of quantum optics and the quantum Langevin equations, the coherent optical spectra are derived. The coherent optical propagation properties and the phenomenon of optomechanically induced transparency based slow-light effect are demonstrated theoretically via manipulating the coupling strength of the two cavities. The results based on the two-WGM cavity optomechanical system are also compared with those based on the single cavity optomechanical system, and the results indicate that the cavity-cavity coupling plays a key role in the system, which indicates a quantum channel, and influences the width of the transparency window. We further theoretically propose a mass sensor based on the double WGM cavity optomechanical system. To implement mass sensing, the first step is to determine the original frequency of the resonator. With adjusting the detuning parameters and the cavity-cavity coupling strength, a straightforward method to measure the resonance frequency of the WGM optomechanical resonator is proposed. The resonance frequency of the mechanical resonator can be determined from the probe transmission spectrum, and the coupling strength between the two cavities will enhance both the line width and the intensity, which will be beneficial to implementing mass sensing. The mass of external nanoparticles deposited onto the WGM optomechanical cavity can be measured conveniently by tracking the mechanical resonance frequency shifts due to the fact that mass changes in the probe transmission spectrum. Compared with those of single-cavity optomechanical mass sensors, the mass sensitivity and resolution are improved significantly due to the cavity-cavity coupling. This double WGM cavity optomechanical system provides a new platform for exploring the on-chip applications in optical storage and ultrahigh resolution sensing devices. © 2016 Chinese Physical Society.","Cavity optomechanics; Mass sensor; Optomechanically induced transparency; Slow light","Differential equations; Light; Light propagation; Natural frequencies; Optical properties; Optical resonators; Photonic devices; Plasma diagnostics; Probes; Pumping (laser); Quantum optics; Resonance; Resonators; Slow light; Transparency; Cavity optomechanics; Mass sensor; Mechanical resonance frequency; Opto-mechanical systems; Optomechanical cavities; Optomechanically induced transparencies; Quantum Langevin equations; Straight-forward method; Whispering gallery modes"

Previously it has been shown that if the mechanical resonances have nearly equal frequencies, one can make the oscillators to interact via the cavity by strong pumping with a coherent pump tone. One can view the interaction also as emergence of an electromagnetically dark mode which gets asymptotically decoupled from the cavity and has a linewidth much smaller than that of the bare cavity. The narrow linewidth and long lifetime of the dark mode could be advantageous, for example in information storage and processing. Here we investigate the possibility to create dark modes dynamically using two pump tones. We show that if the mechanical frequencies are intrinsically different, one can bring the mechanical oscillators and the cavity on-resonance and thus create a dark mode by double sideband pumping of the cavity. We realize the scheme in a microwave optomechanical device employing two drum oscillators with unmatched frequencies, ω1/2π = 8.1 MHz and ω2/2π = 14.2 MHz.

By observing multiple vibrational modes simultaneously, the mass and position of the adsorbed analyte can be determined more accurately [2-3]. Additionally, by using optomechanical actuation and detection of nanomechanical devices, the displacement sensitivity can be improved significantly, which is highly beneficial for mass sensing applications [4-5]. In particular, optomechanical transduction can be achieved using integrated photonics, which is a compact approach that greatly simplifies the optomechanical measurement [6]. However, even vibrational modes are difficult to detect with integrated photonics, since with even modes there is a zero effective index shift over the vibrating beam. In this work, we demonstrate the measurement of even nanomechanical modes [7]. We fabricated a doubly clamped beam by releasing a straight section of an optical racetrack resonator from the silicon dioxide underneath. By performing this process twice, a step is fabricated in the substrate beneath the beam. The step permits the excitation and detection of even modes of vibration due to a nonzero effective index shift. Transduction of odd modes is retained. The displacement sensitivities of the first through third modes are obtained from measurements of the thermomechanical noise floor, and are 228 fm Hz-1/2, 153 fm Hz-1/2, and 112 fm Hz-1/2, respectively. The devices are actuated by the optical force, by modulating a pump laser with an electro-optic modulator. With the addition of the driving force, up to the fifth vibrational mode is observed. The driving force for the first through third modes is compared and modeled based on integration over the mode shapes. Since the step length is approximately 38% of the beam length, the optical force on each mode is approximately 0.4 pN μm-1mW-1 for an applied optical power of 0.07 mW. © 2016 IEEE.","nano-optomechanics; nanomechanics; nanophotonics; silicon photonics","Bacteriophages; Modulators; Nanomechanics; Nanophotonics; Photonic devices; Pumping (laser); Thermomechanical treatment; Vibration analysis; Electro-optic modulators; Nanomechanical device; Opto-mechanics; Optomechanical actuation; Silicon photonics; Single-molecule detection; Thermomechanical noise; Vibrational resonance; Photonics"

For the PCNCs which are made of low-index materials, the corresponding quality factors of TE2 modes reach the highest values relative to previously demonstrated PhC nanobeam cavities with the same low-index materials to the best of our knowledge.

Motivated by the optomechancial experiment with the membrane located in a high-finesse optical cavity and theoretical treatment on two membranes cavity optomechanics, we here study the optomechanical interaction of the system consisting of triple membranes within an optical cavity. The increase of membranes will increase the normal modes of the cavity and mechanical fields, and thus enrich the forms of optomechanical interaction. Firstly, we use the transfer matrix and resonance transmission methods to obtain the dispersion relation between the eigen-frequencies of the optical modes and the mechanical motions. Owing to the existence of triple mechanical membranes, the system possesses different forms of collective mechanical motion, and here we focus on the center-of-mass (COM) motion and relative motion of the equally placed membranes. The numerical solutions of the dispersion relation show that the optical eigenmodes are comprised of a group of closely spaced avoided-crossing quaternion of wave numbers, which arise from the transmission and reflection of the optical field at the membranes and the tunneling couplings between subcavity modes. Moreover, the change of each eigen wave number along each form of the mechanical motion is different, which implies the different forms of optomechanical coupling between eigenmodes and mechanical motions. Then, to achieve the explicit expressions of the optomechanical coupling, it is sufficient to use the perturbation method under the equilibrium condition of the system, where the amplitude of mechanical motion is much smaller than the optical wavelength. With using the implicit function differentiation theorem, the optomechanical coupling strengths between the four optical modes and the COM and relative mechanical motions are obtained respectively. We find that the strong quadratic optomechanical coupling between the optical modes and COM motion can be achieved, and the linear and quadratic couplings between the optical modes and relative motion can both be realized. By tuning the laser to pump different optical modes, we can choose either the linear or the quadratic coupling to the relative motion. Our method is universal to multi-membrane system, and the results may provide some references to theoretical and experimental investigations on the multi-membrane cavity optomechanics. © 2016 Chinese Physical Society.","Collective mechanical motion; Dispersion relation; Multi-membrane cavity optomechanics; Optomechanical coupling strength","Couplings; Dispersion (waves); Dispersions; Perturbation techniques; Pumping (laser); Quantum theory; Transfer matrix method; Cavity optomechanics; Coupling strengths; Dispersion relations; Equilibrium conditions; Experimental investigations; High finesse optical cavities; Mechanical motions; Theoretical treatments; Membranes"

We propose and theoretically analyze a one-way chain starting from various quantum states of radiation. In the chain, the radiation state is first ideally swapped to a sufficiently large mechanical oscillator (membrane). Then the membrane mechanically pushes a classical almost massless piston, which is pressing a gas in a small container. As a result, we observe strongly nonlinear and nonmonotonic transfer of the energy stored in classical and quantum uncertainty of radiation to mechanical work. The amount of work and even its sign depend strongly on the uncertainty of the radiation state.

In this paper, we propose a scheme for controlling the quantum state of light using the mechanical degree of freedom as a controlled beam splitter. Preparing the mechanical resonator in non-classical states enables an optomechanical Stern-Gerlach interferometer. When the mechanical resonator has a small coherent amplitude it acts as a quantum control, entangling the optical and mechanical degrees of freedom. As the coherent amplitude of the resonator increases, we recover single photon and two-photon interference via a classically controlled beam splitter. The visibility of the two-photon interference is particularly sensitive to coherent excitations in the mechanical resonator and this could form the basis of an optically transduced weak-force sensor. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.","classical control; one-photon and two-photon interferometry; optomechanics; quantum control; single photon; single photon measurement","Control theory; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Optical instruments; Particle beams; Photons; Prisms; Resonators; Classical control; Opto-mechanics; Quantum control; Single photons; Two photon; Quantum theory"

An important feature of such an equation is that it allows to treat not only absorption and emission of quanta, but also scattering processes, which however had very few applications in physical modelling. Moreover, recent developments have shown that also some non-Markovian dynamics can be generated by suitable choices of the state of the quantum noises involved in the HP-equation. This paper is devoted to an application involving these two features, non-Markovianity and scattering process. We consider a micro-mirror mounted on a vibrating structure and reflecting a laser beam, a process giving rise to a radiation-pressure force on the mirror. We show that this process needs the scattering part of the HP-equation to be described. On the other side, non-Markovianity is introduced by the dissipation due to the interaction with some thermal environment which we represent by a phonon field, with a nearly arbitrary excitation spectrum, and by the introduction of phase noise in the laser beam. Finally, we study the full power spectrum of the reflected light and we show how the laser beam can be used as a temperature probe. © 2016 Polish Scientific Publishers","heterodyne detection; quantum Langevin equations; quantum optomechanics; quantum stochastic differential equations; radiation pressure interaction",

Cavities supporting spectrally close multiple resonance modes can favor energy exchange among the modes and the ambient, enabling nontrivial coherent dynamics that are useful in wave manipulation. Coupling between multimode cavities with multiple waveguides is a significant theme for optical, terahertz, and microwave signal control, but remains largely unexplored. Here we present a phenomenological modeling based on the coupled mode theory (CMT) that fully accounts for the interplays between such a cavity and surrounding waveguide structures in a generic situation with asymmetric coupling rates between the guiding channels and the resonant modes. It is shown that the waveguide-cavity couplings are crucial for the energy steering between the modes and their far-field radiation and provide flexible control over waveguide transmission featured with a multiple Fano line profile.

The intrinsic dispersion characteristics of optomechanical squeezing around the mechanical frequency are able to produce squeezing at different quadratures over the spectrum, a feature required by gravitational-wave interferometers to beat the standard quantum limit over an extended frequency range. Under realistic assumptions we show that the amount of available squeezing and the intrinsic quadrature rotation may provide, compared to similar amounts of fixed-quadrature squeezing, a detection advantage. A significant challenge for this scheme, however, is the amount of excess noise that is generated in the unsqueezed quadrature at frequencies near the mechanical resonance. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","gravitational-wave detectors; Optomechanics; quadrature rotation; sensitivity enhancement; squeezing","Acoustics; Gravitational effects; Interferometers; Dispersion characteristics; Gravitational wave detectors; Gravitational wave interferometers; Opto-mechanics; Quadrature squeezing; Sensitivity enhancements; squeezing; Standard quantum limits; Gravity waves"

Since symmetry sets fundamental bounds on the optical response, symmetry breaking changes the properties of metamaterials qualitatively over the entire resonant frequency band. This is achieved by a polarized pump beam, exerting optical forces which are not constrained by the structural symmetry. This new concept is illustrated for a metasurface composed of zig-zag chains of dipole meta-atoms, in which a highly asymmetric optical force exists for an appropriate incident polarization. The effect is employed to transform a planar achiral metasurface into a stereoscopic chiral structure. Importantly, the handedness of the induced chirality can be actively switched by changing the incident polarization. The proposed concept can be employed to achieve dynamic spatial control of metamaterials and metasurfaces at infrared and optical frequencies with subwavelength resolution. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Excitation at two laser wavelengths, 780 and 405 nm, corresponding to different absorptions of the multilayer, is examined. Such dual driving will lead to a more flexible optomechanical operation. Topographic reconstruction of the whole static membrane deformation and cooling of the membrane oscillations are reported. The cooling, observed for blue laser detuning and produced by bolometric forces, is deduced from the optomechanical damping of the membrane eigenfrequency.

The OFRR is a glass capillary with an outer diameter of approximately 130 μm and a wall thickness in the order of 1∼10 μm. The circular cross section of the OFRR supports the high-Q whispering gallery mode (WGM) that circulates along the circumference. Incoming ultrasound pressure results in a small refractive index change in the glass wall and geometrical change in the OFRR shape, both of which in turn lead to a spectral shift in the WGM that can be sensitively detected owing to WGM with high optical Q-factors (&gt;107). Due to the suspension nature of the OFRR, the ultrasound detection can be carried out in air, which is advantageous in comparison with other ultrasound detections that require acoustic coupling media such water, gel or solid. The sensitivity can be tuned and optimized by changing the diameter and wall thickness. Besides the optical detection, we also demonstrate optomechanical ultrasound mixing, in which optomechanical vibration is first excited within the OFRR that subsequently modulates the ultrasound wave. Our work will lead to the development of a new type of air-coupled ultrasound detector that can be used for photo-acoustic imaging, non-invasive ultrasound detection of external objects, and ultrasound detection/characterization of internal objects (such as particles and liquids) flowing inside the capillary. © 2016 SPIE.","Microfluidics; Optical resonators; Optomechanics; Photoacoustics; Remote detection; Ultrasound detection","Chemical detection; Glass; Microfluidics; Object detection; Optical resonators; Photoacoustic effect; Photons; Q factor measurement; Refractive index; Resonators; Suspensions (fluids); Whispering gallery modes; Air-coupled ultrasounds; Circular cross-sections; Opto-mechanics; Photo-acoustic imaging; Refractive index changes; Remote detection; Ultrasound detection; Ultrasound detectors; Ultrasonic applications"

After one-hundred years of theoretical investigation and fifty years of experimental endeavor, this is a historical landmark not just for physics and astronomy, but also for industry and manufacturing. The challenge and opportunity for industry is precision and innovative manufacturing in large size - production of large and homogeneous optical components, optical diagnosis of large components, high reflectance dielectric coating on large mirrors, manufacturing of components for ultrahigh vacuum of large volume, manufacturing of high attenuating vibration isolation system, production of high-power high-stability single-frequency lasers, production of high-resolution positioning systems etc. In this talk, we address the requirements and methods to satisfy these requirements. Optical diagnosis of large optical components requires large phase-shifting interferometer; the 1.06 μm Phase Shifting Interferometer for testing LIGO optics and the recently built 24"" phase-shifting Interferometer in Chengdu, China are examples. High quality mirrors are crucial for laser interferometric GW detection, so as for ring laser gyroscope, high precision laser stabilization via optical cavities, quantum optomechanics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and vacuum birefringence measurement. There are stringent requirements on the substrate materials and coating methods. For cryogenic GW interferometer, appropriate coating on sapphire or silicon are required for good thermal and homogeneity properties. Large ultrahigh vacuum components and high attenuating vibration system together with an efficient metrology system are required and will be addressed. For space interferometry, drag-free technology and weak-light manipulation technology are must. Drag-free technology is well-developed. Weak-light phase locking is demonstrated in the laboratories while weak-light manipulation technology still needs developments. © 2016 SPIE.","gravitationalwave astronomy; Innovative manufacturing; Metrological requirements; Ultrahigh precision laser interferometry","Astronomy; Coatings; Drag; Electrodynamics; Gravitational effects; Gravity waves; Interferometers; Interferometry; Laser interferometry; Light; Locks (fasteners); Manufacture; Mirrors; Optical systems; Phase shift; Quantum electronics; Quantum theory; Ring lasers; Sapphire; Ultrahigh vacuum; Units of measurement; Birefringence measurements; Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics; Innovative manufacturing; Metrological requirements; Phase-shifting interferometers; Theoretical investigations; Ultrahigh precision; Vibration isolation systems; Laser mirrors"

OCT is an established, but dynamic imagistic technique based on laser interferometry, which offers micrometer resolutions and millimeters penetration depths. With regard to existing devices, the newly developed handheld probes are simple, light and relatively low cost. Their design is described in detail to allow for the reproduction in any lab, including for educational purposes. Two probes are constructed almost entirely from off-the-shelf components, while a third, final variant is constructed with dedicated components, in an ergonomic design. The handheld probes have uni-dimensional (1D) galvanometer scanners therefore they achieve transversal sections through the biological sample investigated-in contrast to handheld probes equipped with bi-dimensional (2D) scanners that can also achieve volumetric (3D) reconstructions of the samples. These latter handheld probes are therefore also discussed, as well as the possibility to equip them with galvanometer 2D scanners or with Risley prisms. For galvanometer scanners the optimal scanning functions studied in a series of previous works are pointed out; these functions offer a higher temporal efficiency/duty cycle of the scanning process, as well as artifact-free OCT images. The testing of the handheld scanning probes in dental applications is presented, for metal ceramic prosthesis and for teeth. © 2016 SPIE.","biomedical imaging; dentistry; galvanometers; Handheld probes; Optical Coherence Tomography; optical design; optomechanics; scanning systems","Biotechnology; Dentistry; Ergonomics; Galvanometers; Laser interferometry; Medical imaging; Metal testing; Optical design; Optical tomography; Tomography; Biomedical imaging; Ceramic prosthesis; Dental applications; Galvanometer scanner; Handhelds; Off-the-shelf components; Opto-mechanics; Scanning systems; Scanning"

The FSM has an effective diameter of 3.2 m and built as seven 1.1 m diameter circular segments, which are conjugated 1:1 to the seven 8.4m segments of the primary. Each FSM segment contains a tip-tilt capability for fine co-alignment of the telescope sub-apertures and fast guiding to attenuate telescope wind shake and mount control jitter. This tip-tilt capability thus enhances performance of the telescope in the seeing limited observation mode. As the first stage of the FSM development, Phase 0 study was conducted to develop a program plan detailing the design and manufacturing process for the seven FSM segments. The FSM development plan has been matured through an internal review by the GMTO-KASI team in May 2016 and fully assessed by an external review in June 2016.

The visible channels require precision in alignment and stability to provide good image quality in short wavelengths. This is most often accomplished by choosing materials with near zero thermal expansion glass or ceramic mirrors metered with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) that are designed to have a matching thermal expansion. The IR channels are less sensitive to alignment but they often require cryogenic cooling for improved sensitivity with the reduced radiometric background. Finding efficient solutions to this difficult problem of maintaining good visible image quality at cryogenic temperatures has been explored with the building and testing of a telescope simulator. The telescope simulator is an onaxis ZERODUR® mirror, CFRP metered set of optics. Testing has been completed to accurately measure telescope optical element alignment and mirror figure changes in a cryogenic space simulated environment.

Here, we add a new function to femtosecond laserbased single monolith in amorphous fused silica by demonstrating a transparent 3D micro-actuator using non-ablative femtosecond laser micromachining with subsequent chemical etching. The actuation principle is based on dielectrophoresis (DEP), defined as the unbalanced electrostatic action on dielectrics, due to an induced dipole moment under a non-uniform electric field. An analytical model of this actuation scheme is proposed, which is capable of performance prediction, design parameter optimization and motion instability analysis. Furthermore, the static and dynamic performances are experimentally characterized using optical measurement methods. An actuation range of 30 μm is well attainable; resonances and the settling time in transient responses are measured; the quality factor and the bandwidth for the primary vertical resonance are also evaluated. Experimental results are in good consistence with theoretical analyses. The proposed actuation principle suppresses the need for electrodes on the mobile, non-conductive component and is particularly interesting for moving transparent elements. Thanks to the flexibility of femtosecond laser manufacturing process, this actuation scheme can be integrated in other functionalities within monolithic transparent Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) for applications like resonators, adaptive lenses and integrated photonics circuits. © 2016 SPIE.","3D actuators; 3D manufacturing; Dielectrophoresis actuation; Femtosecond laser micromachining; MEMS","Actuators; Adaptive optics; Composite micromechanics; Dielectric materials; Electric fields; Electrophoresis; Electrostatic actuators; Electrostatics; Fused silica; Manufacture; Microactuators; Micromachining; Microoptics; Optical data processing; Photonics; Quality control; Ultrashort pulses; Dielectric interactions; Electrostatic microactuators; Femtosecond laser micromachining; Micro electromechanical system (MEMS); Nonuniform electric field; Optical measurement methods; Static and dynamic performance; Threedimensional (3-d); MEMS"

This coherent bilateral transfer, demonstrated most recently in a single device design, holds promise for the eventual demonstration of coherent transfer in the quantum domain. The basis of design for the devices with which this was accomplished is an optomechanical crystal that supports co-located optical and mechanical resonant modes, coupled to one other via moving boundary (index of refraction) modulation, either induced by motion from energy in the mechanical mode, or by optical pressure due to energy in the optical mode.

Distance dependence is essential in quantum teleportation and relativistic quantum information considerations. The presence of a quantum field as the environment accords an indirect interaction between the two oscillators at finite separation of a non-Markovian nature which competes with the direct coupling between them. The interplay between these two factors results in a rich variety of interesting entanglement behaviors at late times. We show that the entanglement behavior reported in prior work assuming no separation between the detectors can at best be a transient effect at very short times and claims that such behaviors represent late-time entanglement are misplaced. Entanglement between the detectors with direct coupling enters in the consideration of macroscopic quantum phenomena and other frontline issues. We find that with direct coupling entanglement between the two detectors can sustain over a finite distance, in contrast to the no direct coupling case reported before, where entanglement cannot survive at a separation more than a few inverse high-frequency cutoff scales.

In the presence of an optical field between its mirrors, the high-finesse optomechanical resonator acts as an oscillator driven by a radiation pressure force. The periodic nature of the radiation pressure force makes the nano-mechanical membrane in the optomechanical system as a kicked harmonic oscillator. Mathematically the physical system displays a stochastic web map that helps to understand several properties of the kicked membrane in classical phase space. We find that our web map is area preserving and displays quasiperiodic symmetrical structures in phase space which we express as q-fold symmetry. It is shown that under appropriate control of certain parameters, namely the frequency ratio and the kicking strength, the dynamics of kicked membrane exhibits chaotic dynamics.

The manipulation of the quantum state of light is within the reach of systems based on a Fabry-Perot cavity with a Micro-Opto-Mechanical-System (MOMS) resonators used as end-mirror. To approach the quantum regime, these micro devices must satisfy two basic requirements: low optical and mechanical losses. We have recently proposed a class of very low loss MOMS devices working in the 100 kHz frequency region, based on two-side MEMS processing bulk-micromachining. In this work we describe our latest process development, based on the used of pure aluminum as a masking layer for the optical coating during fabrication, that significantly improves the quality of the devices and the yield of the process, opening the way for their use in integrated systems for quantum optics. The devices show very high optical quality (finesse up to 105 can be achieved in optical cavity) and a mechanical quality factor over 106 at cryogenic temperatures. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

R. Galley, R. O. Behunin, and B. L. Hu [Phys. Rev. A 87, 043832 (2013)PLRAAN1050-294710.1103/PhysRevA.87.043832], to describe the quantum entanglement between a mirror's center-of-mass (c.m.) motion and a field. In contrast with the conventional approach where the mirror-field entanglement is understood as arising from the radiation pressure of an optical field inducing the motion of the mirror's c.m., the MOF model incorporates the dynamics of the internal degrees of freedom of the mirror that couple to the optical field directly. The major advantage in this approach is that it provides a self-consistent treatment of the three pertinent subsystems (the mirror's c.m. motion, its internal degrees of freedom, and the field) including their back-actions on each other, thereby giving a more accurate account of the quantum correlations between the individual subsystems. The optical and the mechanical properties of a mirror arising from its dynamical interaction with a quantum field are obtained without imposing any boundary conditions on the field additionally, as is done in the conventional way. As one of the new physical features that arise from this self-consistent treatment of the coupled optics and mechanics behavior we observe a coherent transfer of quantum correlations from the field to the mirror via its internal degrees of freedom. We find the quantum entanglement between the optical field and the mirror's center-of-mass motion upon coarse-graining over the internal degree of freedom. Further, we show that in certain parameter regimes the mirror-field entanglement is enhanced when the field interacts resonantly with the mirror's internal degree of freedom, a result which highlights the importance of including the internal structure of the mirror in quantum optomechanical considerations. © 2015 American Physical Society.",,"Java programming language; Mechanics; Mirrors; Quantum entanglement; Center of mass motion; Conventional approach; Dynamical interactions; Internal degrees of freedom; Microscopic modeling; Quantum correlations; Quantum optomechanics; Self-consistent treatment; Degrees of freedom (mechanics)"

All dielectrics deform in response to light of all frequencies. We derive a dimensionless number to estimate when light can induce large deformation. For a structure made of soft dielectrics, with feature size comparable to the wavelength of light, the structure shapes the light, and the light deforms the structure. We study this two-way interaction between light and structure by combining the electrodynamics of light and the nonlinear mechanics of elasticity.

We show that this system exhibits synchronisation, where all oscillators are rotating at the same rate, and that in the synchronised state the system has a regular structure related to the distribution of the frequencies of the individual oscillators. Using a geometric description, we show how changes in the non-linear coupling function can cause pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations which create or destroy stable and unstable synchronised solutions.

This field of research has been gathering a lot of momentum during the last couple of years, driven by the technological advances in microfabrication and the first observation of quantum phenomena. These results open new perspectives in a wide range of applications, including high sensitivity measurements of position, acceleration, force, mass, and for fundamental research. We are working on low frequency pondero-motive light squeezing as a tool for improving the sensitivity of audio frequency measuring devices such as magnetic resonance force microscopes and gravitational-wave detectors. It is well known that experiments aiming to produce and manipulate non-classical (squeezed) light by effect of optomechanical interaction need a mechanical oscillator with low optical and mechanical losses. These technological requirements permit to maximize the force per incoming photon exerted by the cavity field on the mechanical element and to improve the element's response to the radiation pressure force and, at the same time, to decrease the influence of the thermal bath. In this contribution we describe a class of mechanical devices for which we measured a mechanical quality factor up to 1.2 × 106 and with which it was possible to build a Fabry-Perot cavity with optical finesse up to 9 × 104. From our estimations, these characteristics meet the requirements for the generation of radiation squeezing and quantum correlations in the â1/4 100kHz region. Moreover our devices are characterized by high reproducibility to allow inclusion in integrated systems. We show the results of the characterization realized with a Michelson interferometer down to 4.2K and measurements in optical cavities performed at cryogenic temperature with input optical powers up to a few mW. We also report on the dynamical stability and the thermal response of the system. © 2015 COPYRIGHT SPIE.","High-precision measurements; Low-loss resonators; Optomechanics","Actuators; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Fabry-Perot interferometers; Gravity waves; Magnetic resonance; Michelson interferometers; Oscillators (mechanical); Oscillistors; Pressure; Smart sensors; Stability; Gravitational wave detectors; High sensitivity measurement; High-precision measurement; Low-loss; Mechanical quality factors; Opto-mechanics; Optomechanical cavities; Technological advances; Embedded systems"

Recently, it focused on the exploration of operating mechanical oscillators deep in the quantum regime, with an interest ranging from quantum-classical interface tests to high-precision quantum metrology. In this paper, recent theoretical work of our group in the field of quantum measurement with cavity optomechanical systems is reviewed. We explore the quantum measurement theory and its applications with several unconventional cavity optomechanical schemes working in the quantum regime. This review covers the basics of quantum noises in the cavity optomechanical setups and the resulting standard quantum limit of precision displacement and force measurement. Three novel quantum measurement proposals based on the hybrid optomechanical system are introduced. First, we describe a quantum back-action insulated weak force sensor. It is realized by forming a quantum-mechanics-free subsystem with two optomechanical oscillators of reversed effective mass. Then we introduce a role-reversed atomic optomechanical system which enables the preparation and the quantum tomography of a variety of non-classical states of atoms. In this system, the cavity field acts as a mechanical oscillator driven by the radiation pressure force from an ultracold atomic field. In the end, we recommend a multimode optomechanical transducer that can detect intensities significantly below the single-photon level via adiabatic transfer of the microwave signal to the optical frequency domain. These proposals demonstrate the possible applications of optomechanical devices in understanding of quantum-classical crossover and in achieving quantum measurement limit. ©, 2015, Chinese Physical Society.

Due to their very small mass such devices are extremely sensitive to small fluctuations in the environment and thus allow for making superior sensors. However, because of their small dimensions efficient transduction mechanisms are challenging to develop, both to readout their mechanical motion and to drive them into oscillation. An intriguing property of nanoscale resonators is the fact that they are size-matched to nanophotonic components. Therefore they can be seamlessly integrated into on-chip photonic circuits which enables using optical methods for readout and actuation. In this case the link between mechanical and optical domains is the gradient optical force which can be harnessed for integrated optomechanical interactions. Because gradient forces are a generic optical concepts they can be generated in a wide range of material systems and thus also provide a way to give active functionality to optical circuits where alternative tuning mechanisms do not exist. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Integrated optics; Nanomechanics; Nanophotonics; Optomechanics",

OCT applications can be divided in biomedical (including ophthalmology, skin, dentistry, and endoscopy) and technical, the latter for non-destructive testing (NDT) of various bulk materials (including optical glass and semiconductors) or for the profilometry of metallic surfaces. For both areas it is important to take the technique out of the labs and to move it in the clinical and in the industrial environments, respectively. To achieve this goal, OCT systems have to be equipped with appropriate handheld scanning probes. These must be as light weight as possible to allow for the investigation of a patient in different parts of the body or for aiming at the relevant areas of a manufactured part or system. This paper presents briefly thehandheld probes with 1D galvanometer scanners(GSs) developed in our groups. These have been designed as simple, light weight, and low-cost as possible; they are also versatile, as we have already employed them in a variety of in-house developed OCT systems. Their optomechanical construction in different variants is pointed out. Probes equipped with GS, when driven with a triangular, sawtooth, or custom signals are shown to present advantages to those equipped with Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) when the later operate as resonant scanners driven sinusoidally. The discussion on the GS is based on our previous studies on optimal scanning regimes and techniques to provide artifact/distorsion-free images. An insight in theoptomechanics and in the optical design of the GS and refractive optics combination in the probe head is provided. Two classes of applications we have approached are briefly presented, for dental constructs and for testing the fractures of metallic materials.","biomedical imaging; dentistry.; design; galvanometers; handheld probes; Optical Coherence Tomography; optomechanics; scanning systems","Dentistry; Design; Galvanometers; Imaging techniques; Light; Materials testing; Medical imaging; MEMS; Optical design; Optical glass; Optical tomography; Scanning; Tomography; Biomedical imaging; Handhelds; Industrial environments; Low coherence interferometry; Micro electromechanical system (MEMS); Non destructive testing; Opto-mechanics; Scanning systems; Nondestructive examination"

By developing an automatic phase control system, the phase of the fiber interferometer with a large path imbalance (127 m) can be stabilized in a long term, and the laser excess noise around 800 kHz and its integer multiples can be efficiently suppressed by more than 45 dB. The effective frequency bands of the noise filter can be controlled by adjusting the arm-length difference of the interferometer.

Collapse models provides a quantitative answer for this problem and explain how macroscopic classical world emerges out of microscopic quantum world. A universal noise field is postulated in collapse models, inducing appropriate Brownian- motion corrections to standard quantum dynamics. The strength of collapse-driven Brownian fluctuations depend on: (i) the parameters characterizing the system (e.g., mass, size, density), and (ii) two phenomenological parameters defining the statistical properties of the collapse noise. The collapse-driven Brownian motion works such that microscopic systems behave quantum mechanically, while macroscopic objects are classical. At the intermediate mesocopic scale, collapse models predict deviations from standard quantum predictions. This issue has been subject of experimental tests. All experiments to date have been at the scales where collapse effects are negligible for all practical purposes. However, recent experimental progress in revealing quantum features of larger objects, increases the hope for testing at unprecedented scales where collapse models can be falsified. Current experiments are mainly focused on the preparation of macroscopic systems in a spatial quantum superposition state. The collapse effects would then manifest as loss of visibility in the observed inference pattern. However, one needs a quantum interference with single particles of mass ∼ 1010amu for a decisive test of collapse models. Creating such massive superpositionsis quite challenging, and beyond currectstate-of-the-art. Quite recently, an alternative approach has been proposed where the collapse manifests in the fluctuating properties of light interacting with the quantum system. The great advantage of this new approach is that here there is no need for the preparation of a quantum superposed state. It has been discussed that promising results can be revealed in the spectrum of light interacting with a radiation pressure-driven mechanical oscillator in a cavity optomechanics setting. Here, we review the theoretical modelling of the above optomechenical proposal. We discuss how collapse-driven Brownian motion modifies the spectrum. We quantify the collapse effect and explain how it depends on the parameters of the mechanical oscillator (e.g., mass, density, geometry). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Brownian movement; Oscillators (mechanical); Oscillistors; Quantum optics; Brownian fluctuations; Mechanical oscillators; Parameters characterizing; Quantum interference; Quantum superposition state; Quantum to classical transition; Statistical properties; Theoretical modelling; Quantum theory"

Theoretical treatments of this system have, to date, employed the model of a zero-thickness polarizable slab. The validity of this model is, however, limited, since in general highly reflective subwavelength gratings do not have an optical thickness that is much smaller than the wavelength of the light employed. In this work, we show that this model in fact makes incorrect predictions concerning the field modes in an optical cavity with a subwavelength grating at the exact center. It predicts that the modes can be classified in doublets, one member of which has an antisymmetric spatial profile and no absorption, the other of which has a symmetric spatial profile and absorptive losses. The situation for a subwavelength grating, however, is quite different: Both modes have absorptive loss, but the mode with the antisymmetric spatial profile has greater loss. In addition, the frequencies of the modes are interchanged: In the case of the zero-thickness slab, the antisymmetric mode has the lower frequency, while in the case of the subwavelength grating, it is the symmetric mode that is the low-frequency member of the doublet. These considerations will be important for a correct interpretation of experimental data as the performance of such sytems continues to improve.","Fabry-Perot; HCG; optomechanics; polarizability; SASER; sub-wavelength","Fabry-Perot interferometers; Fermi level; Thickness control; Fabry-Perot; HCG; Opto-mechanics; Polarizabilities; SASER; Sub-wavelength; Diffraction gratings"

Starting from the fabrication and micromanipulation of individual MNFs, we put emphases on optical properties and technological applications of MNFs, including both passive components and active devices. A brief outlook regarding future possibilities is also presented. Optical microfibers and nanofibers (MNFs) are optical fibers with diameters close to or smaller than the wavelength of the guided light. A number of names, such as “subwavelength-diameter optical fiber/wire”, “optical microfiber”, “optical nanofiber”, “fiber taper”, “tapered fiber”, “fiber nanowire”, “photonic/optical nanowire”, “submicron-diameter fiber” and “ultrathin fiber”, have been used to mention these one-dimensional (1D) micro/nanoscale waveguides in various literatures. For simplicity, here we use the name “MNF” to cover these tiny optical fibers with diameters from tens of nanometers to several micrometers. When its size goes down to the wavelength of the guided light, an optical MNF exhibits interesting properties such as tight optical confinement, strong near-field interaction, steep field gradient, abnormal dispersion, enhanced surface effects and excellent mechanical flexibilities [1–7], which opens opportunities for combining waveguide optics with near-field optics, nonlinear optics, plasmonics, quantum optics and optomechanics on the nanoscale [8–12], and intrigues a variety of novel nanophotonic components/devices including nanolasers and nanosensors that may serve as a valuable technological platform for Lab on fiber.

Due to their very small mass such devices are extremely sensitive to small fluctuations in the environment and thus allow for making superior sensors. However, because of their small dimensions efficient transduction mechanisms are challenging to develop, both to readout their mechanical motion and to drive them into oscillation. An intriguing property of nanoscale resonators is the fact that they are size-matched to nanophotonic components. Therefore they can be seamlessly integrated into on-chip photonic circuits which enables using optical methods for readout and actuation. In this case the link between mechanical and optical domains is the gradient optical force which can be harnessed for integrated optomechanical interactions. Because gradient forces are a generic optical concepts they can be generated in a wide range of material systems and thus also provide a way to give active functionality to optical circuits where alternative tuning mechanisms do not exist. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.

The pendulum oscillation modulates the microsphere's whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonance frequencies (dispersive shift) and the external coupling rate (dissipative effect). These effects combine to give an observable modulation in the transmitted optical power so that the tapered fiber also acts as the mechanical motion transducer. This unique mechanism leads to an asymmetric response function of the transduction spectrum, i.e. the amplitude of the transmitted noise depends on laser detuning. This phenomenon can be explained using coupled mode theory with a Fourier transformation. The transduction of the mechanical motion and its relation to the external coupling gap was experimentally investigated and showed good agreement with the theory. © 2015 SPIE CCC.","Micropendulum; Optomechanics; Sensor; Whispering gallery","Bacteriophages; Fourier series; Fourier transforms; Laser resonators; Microspheres; Optical fibers; Optical waveguides; Pendulums; Resonators; Sensors; Asymmetric response; Dissipative effects; Fourier transformations; Micropendulum; Opto-mechanics; Resonance frequencies; Tapered optical fibers; Whispering gallery; Whispering gallery modes"

A NEMS spring mechanism with multi-degree of freedom (DOF) is adopted here. Double-coupled nanobeam photonic crystal cavities (PCCs) are utilized to pump the optical spring effect. One of the PCCs is fixed, while the other is driven by the NEMS mechanism. We investigate the shift of the mechanism's firstorder in-plane translational (I1) resonance mode tuned by the incident laser wavelengths across the fourth-order even (TE<inf>e,4</inf>) and odd (TE<inf>o,4</inf>) modes of the coupled cavities. It shows a nonlinear relationship between the I1 mechanical frequency and the laser wavelength. We also investigate the frequency of the third-order torsional (T3) mode versus the wavelengths across the same cavity TE<inf>e,4</inf> mode and it shows a weaker torsional optical spring effect. © 2015 SPIE.","nanophotonics and photonic crystals; nanostructure fabrication; optical microelectromechanical devices; optomechanics","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Microelectromechanical devices; MOEMS; NEMS; Photonic crystals; Ultrasonic devices; Mechanical frequency; Mechanical resonant frequencies; Multi degree-of-freedom; Nano electromechanical systems; Nanostructure fabrication; Non-linear relationships; Opto-mechanics; Photonic crystal cavities; Natural frequencies"

By exciting the acoustic eigenmodes of slab waveguides, the refractive indices and interfaces of silicon slab can be modulated periodically to perturb the guided optical waves and open up the photonic band gaps. We find that the occurrence of the strong forbidden effect to form the band gaps is due to nonlinear interactions between the guided optical and acoustic modes. Using the finite-element method, we calculate the photonic band structures of TE waves and TM waves under the perturbation of the lowest three acoustic eigenmodes, respectively. The results show that the fundamental symmetric acoustic slab mode can create Bragg photonic band gaps of tunable width. With generating acoustic-wave amplitude of 1.0 % of the slab thickness, photonic band gaps from 61.58 - 61.92 THz for TE and 89.10 - 89.24 THz for TM are demonstrated.

Amongst the different physical implementations, optomechanical (OM) crystals built on semiconductor slabs would enable the integration and manipulation of multiple OM elements in a single chip and provide GHz phonons suitable for coherent phonon manipulation. Different demonstrations of coupling of infrared photons and GHz phonons in cavities created by inserting defects on OM crystals have been performed. However, the considered structures do not show a complete phononic bandgap at the frequencies of interest, which in principle should allow longer dephasing time, since acoustic leakage is minimized. In this work we discuss the excitation of acoustic modes in a 1D OM crystal properly designed to display a full phononic bandgap for acoustic modes at about 4 GHz. The confined phonons have an OM coupling ranging from the kHz to the MHz range with contributions from moving interfaces and the photoelastic effect that add constructively for many of them. The modes inside the complete bandgap are designed to have high mechanical Q factors and invariant to fabrication imperfections, what would allow several coherent phonon manipulations at moderate cryogenic temperatures. © 2014 IEEE.","optomechanics; phononics; photonics","Energy gap; Phonons; Photonics; Transparent optical networks; Vibrations (mechanical); Cavity optomechanics; Coherent phonons; Cryogenic temperatures; Fabrication imperfections; Infrared photons; Opto-mechanics; phononics; Semiconductor slabs; Lattice vibrations"

In everyday life applications this linear momentum of light is too small to play any significant role. However, in nanoscale dimensions, the associated optical forces start to play an increasingly important role. These forces are, e.g., large enough for exiting experiments in the fields of cavity-optomechanics, laser cooling and optical trapping of small particles. Recently, it has been suggested that optical gradient forces can also be employed for all-optical actuation in micro- and nanophotonic systems. The typical setup consists of two slab waveguides positioned in each others vicinity such that they are coupled through the interaction of the evanescent tails. Although the gradient forces between these waveguides can be enhanced considerably using electromagnetic resonators or slow-light techniques, the resulting displacements remain relatively small. In this contribution, we present an alternative approach to enhance optical gradient forces between waveguides using a combination of transformation optics and metamaterials. Our design starts from the observation that gradient forces exponentially decay with the separation distance between the waveguides. Therefore, we employ transformation optics to annihilate the apparent distance for light between the waveguides. Analytical calculations confirm that the resulting forces indeed increase when such an annihilating cladding is inserted. Subsequently, we discuss the metamaterial implementation of this annihilating medium. Such lensing media automatically translate into anisotropic metamaterials with negative components in the permittivity and permeability tensors. Our full-wave numerical simulations show that the overall amplification is highly limited by the loss-tangent of the metamaterial cladding. However, as this cladding only needs to operate in the near-field for a specific polarization, we can also consider single-negative metamaterial implementations. We finally demonstrate that in this way metamaterials can support optical forces enhanced by more than 200 times [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 057401 (2013)]. © 2014 Copyright SPIE.","Electromagentic waves; Electromagnetic waveguides; Metamaterials; Optical forces; Transformation optics","Energy transfer; Light; Optics; Waveguides; Analytical calculation; Anisotropic metamaterials; Electromagnetic resonators; Electromagnetic waveguides; Optical force; Permeability tensors; Separation distances; Transformation optics; Metamaterials"

Optomechanics combines advances in nano-and electromechanical systems with radiation pressure enabled control. The radiation pressure backaction enables to readout mechanical motion of micro-and nanoscale mechanical oscillators with an imprecision at the standard quantum limit, enables to amplify2 mechanical motion-enabling coherent mechanical oscillators. Likewise the cooling3,4 of mechanical oscillators has enabled to access the quantum regime of optomechanical systems. Likewise mechanical degrees of freedom provide new ways to control the propagation of light via the phenomenon of optomechanically induced transparency5, which can e.g. enable switching, slowing or advancing of electromagnetic pulses6. Cavity optomechanical systems also have reached the quantum regime of mechanical oscillators, which has been long anticipated. As one example of the possible range of optomechanical phenomena, we review an optomechanical microresonator in which optical and mechanical degrees of freedom exchange energy at a rate exceeding the relevant decoherence rates in the system, enabling quantum control of a mechanical oscillator with light.

PhC cavities have various applications such as quantum information processing, low threshold lasers, optomechanics, and nonlinear optics. PhC cavities based on silicon material have been heavily investigated due to their compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, small feature size and low cost. However, apart from the advantage of high Q factor, silicon based PhC cavities suffer from the drawbacks of high insertion loss because of the mode mismatch with fiber and relatively low sensitivity especially for the sensing application. On the other hand, silicon dioxide (silica) waveguide experience relatively smaller loss and owns a similar refractive index to numerous liquid materials to be detected, which will leads to high sensitivity for a silica based PhC cavity sensor. In this paper, we propose a high Q factor (Q = 15500) silica based PhC nanobeam cavity with high sensitivity (the wavelength shift per refractive index unit (RIU) is S = 338 nm/RIU) at the telecommunication wavelength (1550 nm). Since the refractive index contrast for silica waveguide is low for the realization of the photonic bandgaps, it is essential to utilize a silica waveguide suspended in free space. The PhC nanobeam cavity is then formed by etching a series of elliptical holes, whose dimensions linearly decrease from the center to both ends, directly into the silica waveguide. For the sake of high transmission on-resonance wavelength while maintaining high Q factor, it's important to etch partly into the waveguide, which results in a low-refractive-index perturbation structure. The calculated on-resonance transmission is about 0.26. The novel proposed PhC nanobeam cavity shows a sensitivity 3 times larger than the one based on silicon counterparts and outperforms other low-index-contrast PhC cavities by a higher on-resonance transmission. Such a structure can also be used in spectrally filtering system and nonlinear optics.",,"Nanowires; Nonlinear optics; Plasma filled waveguides; Q factor measurement; Quantum optics; Resonance; Semiconducting silicon; Silica; Waveguides; Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technologies; Low-threshold lasers; Quantum-information processing; Refractive index units; Refractive-index perturbation; Resonance transmission; Resonance wavelengths; Telecommunication wavelengths; Refractive index"

The monolithic device combines high reflectivity, high mechanical quality factor, and low mass. Here we survey results we have obtained using such a device as one mirror of a Fabry-Perot cavity. With a cavity finesse of F 2000, we are able to optically cool hundreds of mechanical modes of the membrane. The lowest effective temperature we achieve, by detuning a laser to the red side of an optical resonance, is approximately Teff = 1 K. The cooling is accompanied by an optically-induced shift of the mechanical frequency, as expected; both the degree of cooling and frequency shift are proportional to the power of the cooling laser. When we detune the laser to the blue side of the resonance, the resulting optical antidamping causes the dynamics of the mechanical system to change from thermal to oscillatory, with a well-defined phase. Finally, we computationally investigate the feasibility of a proposal to realize radiation pressure optomechanics without a cavity, by use of a subwavelength grating with a rapid variation of reflectivity with wavelength. © 2013 SPIE.","Fabry-Perot; HCG; Optomechanics; Sub-wavelength","Fabry-Perot; HCG; High-contrast gratings; Mechanical quality factors; Opto-mechanics; Silicon nitride membrane; Sub-wave length grating; Sub-wavelength; Cooling; Fabry-Perot interferometers; Mirrors; Quantum optics; Silicon nitride; Diffraction gratings"

Suspended low-mass elements (&lt; pg) in the nanomechanical resonator are sensitive to environmental stimuli, such as a magnetic field from external sources or from embedded nanomagnetic systems. The torsional mechanical motion of these elements directly influences the optical field concentrated inside the optical nanocavity, resulting in a strong cavity optomechanical coupling rate up to 90 GHz/nm. The actuation of the mechanical resonator is readout with high sensitivity using evanescent coupling between the photonic crystal nanocavity and an optical fiber taper. A sub-100nm physical air gap in the middle of the nanobeam cavity allows torsional mechanical degrees of freedom as well as strong optical field confinement in a small mode volume.

On-chip micromirror structures offer a way to markedly improve the coupling efficiency between such subwavelength metal apertures and the external fluorescence illumination and collection optics, which in turn greatly simplifies several aspects of instrument design including optics, optomechanics, and thermal control. Modeling and experimental verification of the gains in illumination and collection efficiency for subwavelength metal apertures leads to a micromirror design that is both highly efficient yet also manufacturable. A combination of ray-based and finite-difference-time-domain models is used to optimize conical micromirrors colocated with subwavelength metal apertures for the case where the illumination light interacts strongly with the micromirror and the collection optics have modest numerical aperture (NA∼0.5). Experimental methods employing either freely diffusing or immobilized dye molecules are used to measure the illumination and collection efficiencies of fabricated micromirror prototypes. An overall fluorescence gain of ∼100x, comprising a 20x improvement with flood illumination efficiency together with a 5x improvement in collection efficiency, are both predicted and experimentally verified. © 2013 Copyright SPIE.",,"Collection efficiency; Coupling efficiency; Experimental methods; Experimental verification; Finite difference time-domain; Micromirror structure; Single molecule fluorescence; Sub-wavelength metal apertures; Efficiency; Fluorescence; Metals; Optical resolving power; Optics; Molecules"

We describe here a reversible quantum interface between optical and microwave photons based on a micro-mechanical resonator in a superconducting circuit, simultaneously interacting with an optical and a microwave cavity [3]. When the cavities are appropriately driven, the mechanical resonator mediates an effective parametric amplifier interaction, entangling an optical signal and a microwave idler. Such continuous variable (CV) entanglement can be then exploited to implement CV teleportation. The optical output is mixed with an optical 'client' field in an unknown quantum state on a beam splitter at the transmitting site (Alice). The two outputs are then subject to homodyne detection (see Fig. 1) and the classical measurement results communicated to the receiving site (Bob). Upon receipt of these results, Bob makes a conditional displacement of the microwave field, again using beam splitters and a coherent microwave source. The resulting state of the output microwave field is then prepared in the same quantum state as the optical input state. The process is entirely symmetric: the Alice and Bob roles can be exchanged and an unknown input microwave field can be teleported onto the optical output field at Alice, realising therefore a reversible quantum state transfer between fields at completely different wavelengths. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Light; Micromechanical resonators; Microwave circuits; Microwaves; Optical beam splitters; Optical instruments; Optics; Parametric amplifiers; Prisms; Quantum electronics; Coherent microwaves; Continuous variables; Mechanical resonators; Microwave cavity; Microwave photon; Quantum interfaces; Quantum state transfers; Superconducting circuit; Electron optics"

A notable example of this kind of light beam control is provided by the optomechanical analogue of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), the so called optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT), which has been recently demonstrated [1-3]. In OMIT, the internal resonance of the medium is replaced by a dipole-like interaction of optical and mechanical degrees of freedom which occurs when the pump is tuned to the lower motional sideband of the cavity resonance. OMIT may offer various advantages with respect to standard atomic EIT: i) it does not rely on naturally occurring resonances and could therefore be applied to previously inaccessible wavelength regions; ii) a single optomechanical element can already achieve unity contrast, which in the atomic case is only possible within the setting of cavity quantum electrodynamics; iii) one can achieve significant optical delay times, since they are limited only by the mechanical resonance lifetime 1/γm. Previous OMIT demonstrations have been carried out in a cryogenic setup [1,2]; here we show OMIT in a room temperature optomechanical setup consisting of a thin semitransparent membrane within a high-finesse optical Fabry-Perot cavity [3]. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Cavity resonators; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Resonance; Transparency; Cavity optomechanics; Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics; Electromagnetically-induced transparency; Mechanical resonance; Nanomechanical resonators; Naturally occurring; Opto-mechanical elements; Optomechanically induced transparencies; Electron optics"

As an example, optical rotation of chiral particles was demonstrated [1], and a rich variety of nonlinear behaviour was achieved with magneto-elastic metamaterials [2]. The range of possible effects achievable in this way promises to be richer than in the prominent area of optomechanics, because the greater flexibility in metamaterial design overcomes the limits of available material functionalities, and offers wider possibilities for optimisation. At the same time, the implementation of magnetoelastic metamaterials [2] remains challenging and in some cases, such as the conformational nonlinearity in resonant spirals, remains inaccessible for optics. The reason for this is that the magnetic forces, employed in the initial designs, are relatively weak, so such materials require either high power or extremely small elastic restoring forces, which poses a considerable manufacturing challenge. We recall, however, that earlier research on structurally tunable metamaterials [3] indicated that near-field interaction may significantly improve the tunability range and leads to various effects associated with near-field coupling. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Electromagnetic waves; Electron optics; Optics; Quantum electronics; Chiral particles; Elastic restoring forces; Manufacturing challenges; Mechanical deformation; Near field interactions; Near-field coupling; Nonlinear behaviours; Tunable metamaterials; Metamaterials"

These perturbations in turn modify the light propagation and generate an intricate nonlinear response. We generalise an analytic approach where light propagation in one-dimensional media of inhomogeneous density is modelled as a result of multiple scattering between polarizable slices. Using the Maxwell stress tensor formalism we compute the local optical forces and iteratively approach self-consistent density distributions where the elastic back-action balances gradient- and scattering forces. For an optically trapped finite dielectric we derive the nonlinear dependence of trap position, stiffness and total deformation on the object's size and field configuration. Generally trapping is enhanced by deformation, which exhibits a periodic change between stretching and compression even allowing areas of bistability. This strongly deviates from qualitative expectations based on the change of photon momentum of light crossing the surface of a dielectric. © 2012 SPIE.","Optical manipulation; Optical trapping; Optomechanics","Analytic approach; Density distributions; Elastic dielectrics; Inhomogeneous density; Light forces; Local density; Maxwell stress tensors; Non-linear response; Nonlinear dependence; Optical force; Optical manipulation; Opticaltrapping; Opto-mechanics; Optomechanical; Photon momentum; Scattering and absorption; Scattering forces; Trap positions; Dielectric materials; Light propagation; Micromanipulators; Deformation"

IDOM has been the responsible for the design, manufacturing, assembly and commissioning of the two units of FC-Sets. The design combines a compact layout of the mechanical system, enhanced by an innovative cable wrap design, resulting in a smooth and precise movement, whilst guaranteeing good access to important components and maximizing the maintainability. The custom design of the cable wrap as an evolution of the rolling loop type eliminates the need for a cable chain static housing, minimizing weight and impact on the telescope tube. The AG Mechanics provides the required pointing and focusing capabilities in a compact configuration. In January 2010, IDOM is awarded the design and procurement of the two FC-Sets. The final design is approved by GRANTECAN and the fabrication process starts in Nov 2011. The assembly and commissioning of both units are completed in April 2011.

Two types of resonant modulation are considered: additive, with frequency close to the oscillator eigenfrequency; and parametric, with frequency close to twice the eigenfrequency. It is shown that a relaxation of the oscillator is accompanied by quantum noise. This leads to a finite-width distribution over quantum states even for T = 0. It also leads to switching between coexisting vibrational states via transitions over the barrier in phase space. The switching mechanism, quantum activation, has no analogue in thermal equilibrium systems. The switching rates display characteristic scaling near bifurcation points. The power and absorption/amplification spectra of modulated oscillators are studied, including their fine structure. Nonresonant modulation can lead to cooling, heating, or self-sustained vibrations of an oscillator. The relation between the previously discussed direct nonresonant excitation of the oscillator and the excitation studied in optomechanics is analyzed. © M. I. Dykman 2012.

The flourishing field of cavity optomechanics, in which an electromagnetic resonance couples parametrically to a mechanical oscillator, addresses both of these challenges-providing a nearly ideal architecture for both manipulation and detection of mechanical motion at the quantum level. In this talk, I present experiments in which the motion of a high-Q, micromechanical membrane couples to a superconducting microwave resonator. When this 'cavity' is excited with coherent microwave photons near its resonance, the displacement of the membrane becomes encoded as modulation of this tone. The microwaves, in turn, also impart forces back on the oscillator, which enforce the Heisenberg limits on measurement and can also be exploited either to cool or amplify the motion. The unprecedented optomechanical coupling strength allows the driven system to enter the strong-coupling regime, where the normal modes are now hybrids of the original radio-frequency mechanical and the microwave electrical resonances. This normal-mode splitting is verified by direct spectroscopy of the 'dressed states' of the hybridized cavity resonance, showing excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. As all of these experiments take place in at a temperature below 40 mK, this system operates in the quantum-enabled regime where the thermal decoherence rate is small enough to allow sideband cooling of the mechanical mode to the ground state. By measuring the noise spectrum of this mechanical system with an efficient, nearly shot-noise limited microwave detection, the residual thermal motion of the membrane is easily resolvable above the measurement imprecision. The final part of this talk will quantify the thermal motion occupancy of the mechanical mode as it is cooled with radiation-pressure forces to below its quantum zero-point motion and enters the strong coupling regime.",,"Cavity optomechanics; Coherent microwaves; Electrical resonances; Electromagnetic resonance; Mechanical oscillators; Microwave detection; Strong-coupling regime; Superconducting microwave resonators; Experiments; Microwave resonators; Microwaves; Oscillistors; Quantum electronics; Resonance; Microwave oscillators"

The radiation-pressure inducing the movable mirror and the steady-state amplitude of the cavity field displaying an optical multistable behavior are studied. The modification of mechanical frequency and mechanical damping rate are analyzed induced by radiation pressure, which will change with the change of parametric gain, input laser power and parametric phase. In addition, the fluctuation spectrum of the movable mirror is also analyzed presenting the normal mode splitting with modulating the parametric phase of the driving field. Moreover, an accurate scheme is used to calculate the final effective mean phonon number that demonstrates the ground state cooling. The results show that the cooling of the mirror is dominated by the initial bath temperature, high mechanical quality factor and parametric phase.

A prominent example is the cavity assisted side-band cooling of the mechanical motion, leading to low phonon occupation and thereby approaching the quantum regime [1,2]. However, while the preparation of highly nonclassical light fields like single photon states, entangled states or Schrdinger cat states is today an inherent part of the quantum optics toolbox, the preparation of nonclassical states for nanomechanical devices still constitutes a major challenge [3]. Since the dynamics of purely harmonic oscillators will, even in the quantum regime, not differ from its classical analogue, a crucial requirement for observing quantum effects are effective nonlinearities which are typically provided by an ancilla system (ideally a qubit). Here we explore the alternative paradigm of exploiting the geometric nonlinearity inherent to doubly-clamped mechanical resonators. Thus, we consider the physics of a nanomechanical resonator with a Duffing nonlinearity of the form X 4, coupled to different cavity modes that are each driven by a detuned laser. Here X denotes the mechanical displacement and the strength of the nonlinearity. The system is coupled to its environment with decay rates k j for the cavity modes and m for the mechanical mode. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Ancilla systems; Cat state; Cavity mode; Decay rate; Detuned; Entangled state; Geometric non-linearity; Harmonic oscillators; Light fields; Low-phonon; Mechanical displacements; Mechanical motions; Mechanical resonators; Nanomechanical device; Nanomechanical resonators; Non-classical lights; Non-Linearity; Nonclassical state; Nonlinear mechanical resonators; Opto-mechanics; Optomechanical; Quantum effects; Quantum regimes; Single photon state; Decay (organic); Electron optics; Light; Photons; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Resonators; Quantum entanglement"

We directly compare the normally observed near-field interaction regime driven by the perturbation theory and then report the extraordinary interaction regime. Subsequently, we show that the cavity can take up to 2 min to recover from this interaction after removing the probe and that leads to an extraordinary blue-shift of the cavity resonance wavelength (∼15 nm) which depends on the probe motion above the cavity and not the position. The reasons for this effect are not fully understood yet but we try to give some explanations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Work towards this goal has focused on increasing the strength of the coupling between the mechanical and optical degrees of freedom; however, the form of this coupling is crucial in determining which phenomena can be observed in such a system. Here we demonstrate that avoided crossings in the spectrum of an optical cavity containing a flexible dielectric membrane allow us to realize several different forms of the optomechanical coupling. These include cavity detunings that are (to lowest order) linear, quadratic, or quartic in the membrane's displacement, and a cavity finesse that is linear in (or independent of) the membrane's displacement. All these couplings are realized in a single device with extremely low optical loss and can be tuned over a wide range in situ; in particular, we find that the quadratic coupling can be increased three orders of magnitude beyond previous devices. As a result of these advances, the device presented here should be capable of demonstrating the quantization of the membrane's mechanical energy. © 2010 OSA /FiO/LS 2010.",,"Avoided crossings; Dielectric membranes; Mechanical energies; Mechanical resonators; Optical cavities; Quadratic couplings; Quantum behaviors; Three orders of magnitude; Couplings"

When multiple precise motions need to be made in a system, stages are typically the solution. A number of factors should be considered before choosing a stage: cost, load capacity, travel range, repeatability, resolution, encoding accuracy, errors in motion, stiffness, stability, velocity of motion, environmental sensitivity, and additional features like over-travel protection and locking mechanisms. There are a variety of different bearing types for linear stages, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. This paper presents charts that provide relationships between the cost, travel range, angular deviation, and load capacity of various types of manual one-axis linear stages. The stages considered were those that had less than a 2.5"" travel range and sold by major optomechanical vendors. The bearing types investigated were dovetail, flexure, ball bearing, double row ball bearing, crossed roller bearing, and gothic arch ball bearing.

This treatment, termed the response theory of optical forces (or RTOF), provides conceptual clarity to the essential physics of optomechanical systems, which computationally intensive Maxwell stress-tensor analyses leave obscured, enabling the construction simple models with which optical forces and trapping potentials can be synthesized based on the optical response of optomechanical systems. A theory of optical forces, based on the optical response of systems, is advantageous since the phase and amplitude response of virtually any optomechanical system (involving waveguides, ring resonators or photonic crystals) can be derived, with relative ease, through well-established analytical theories. In contrast, conventional Maxwell stress tensor methods require the computation of complex 3-dimensional electromagnetic field distributions; making a theory for the synthesis of optical forces exceedingly difficult. Through numerous examples, we illustrate that the optical forces generated in complex waveguide and microcavity systems can be computed exactly through use of analytical scattering-matrix methods. When compared with Maxwell stress-tensor methods of force computation, perfect agreement is found. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Gradient forces; Microcavity; Optical forces; Optomechanics; Waveguide","3-dimensional; Amplitude response; Analytical theory; Complex waveguides; Electromagnetic field distribution; Gradient force; Gradient forces; Maxwell stress; Maxwell stress tensor method; Optical force; Optical phase; Optical response; Opto-mechanics; Optomechanical systems; Response theory; Ring resonator; Scattering matrices; Simple model; Tensor method; Trapping potential; Variable systems; Electromagnetic field theory; Laser resonators; Maxwell equations; Microcavities; Photonic crystals; Resonators; Synthesis (chemical); Tensors; Waveguides"

The PSFs are provided by a bundle of 9 different pigtailed laser diodes placed in the object field, and they are recorded by a lensless 2/3"" CCD camera. The comparison of the simulated and obtained PSFs allows determining the optical element introducing the differences so action may be taken precisely on that element. The system is especially useful in non-rotationally symmetrical systems, where errors in axis position result into asymmetries of the PSF images.

This is currently accomplished using large bulk-optic Fourier transform infrared (FT IR) or dispersive spectrometers with complex optomechanics to provide the required spectral discrimination through the selection of a large optical path length. However, the resultant large mass and power requirements carry a high cost penalty and risk for spaceborne missions, requiring costly, large space platforms. This paper describes the breadboarding of an innovative spectrometer concept, the Fabry-Perot (FP) guided-wave integrated optical spectrometer (IOSPEC), which synergistically combines two mature technologies to provide a miniature spectrometer capable of broadband operation at high spectral resolution to below 0.03 nm full width half maximum (FWHM) with a net mass under 3 kg. A special, tailored tunable FP filter is employed to provide the high spectral discrimination, allowing a large spectrometer input aperture. This is matched with a high-performance guided-wave IR spectrometer based on MPB Communications Inc. patented IOSPEC technologies to simultaneously provide the measurement of 256-512 high-resolution spectral channels over a relatively broad spectral range. By tuning the FP filter, a continuum of spectral measurement points can be obtained with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) advantage of at least SQRT(256) over scanned spectrometer systems. The guided-wave optics integration provides robust, long-term optical alignment and minimizes the system mechanical complexity. The FP-IOSPEC spectrometer volume and mass minimization enable multiple spectrometers to be accommodated on a low-cost microsat, optimized for selected measurement tasks and views, thereby enabling significantly improved data acquisition for remote sensing and science while minimizing the mission cost. The application of this innovative technology to the requirements of the potential Miniature Earth Observation Satellite (MEOS) mission to study critical aspects of the carbon and hydrologic cycles associated with climate change is discussed. © 2009 CASI.",,"Atmospheric remote sensing; Bread-boarding; Broad spectral; Broadband operation; Dispersive spectrometers; Earth observation satellites; Fabry-Perot; Fine structures; Fourier transform infrared; Full width half maximum; Gas-phase species; Guided wave optics; High costs; High resolution; High spectral resolution; Hydrologic cycles; Innovative technology; IR spectrometers; Mass minimization; Mechanical complexity; Miniature Spectrometer; Mission costs; Optical absorption; Optical alignments; Optical path lengths; Optical spectrometers; Opto-mechanics; Planetary atmosphere; Power requirement; Space-borne; Spectral channels; Spectral measurement; Climate change; Earth (planet); Fabry-Perot interferometers; Fourier transforms; Gas absorption; Guided electromagnetic wave propagation; Innovation; Optimization; Remote sensing; Signal to noise ratio; Space optics; Space platforms; Spectral resolution; Spectrometry; Spectrometers"

In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of parallel silicon waveguides with a cross section of 250nm × 220nm, and photonic crystal nanobeam cavities with an air gap as small as 50nm between these released structures. The waveguides have been suspended over a distance of more than 75um. Stiction is a major issue for releasing structures with gaps in the order of tens of nanometers. At the same time, the process has to be gentle due to the small dimensions of the structures involved in the release process. HF vapor etching technique was successfully utilized to etch the 2um thick thermally grown sacrificial silicon o×ide layer. This process has an high yield as no liquid is in contact with the structures being released, thus eliminating any kind of liquid flow which typically proves to be a potential destruction source for such small structures. This HF vapor phase etching is a simple and controllable process which completely eliminates the requirement of any kind of sophisticated drying techniques needed with conventional wet etching. © 2009 SPIE.","HF vapor; Optical resonators; Optomechanics; Photonic crystals; Sacrificial etching; Stiction; Waveguides","Air gaps; Cross sections; Drying techniques; Etching techniques; HF vapor; Hf vapor etchings; High yields; Liquid flows; Optomechanics; Release process; Sacrificial etching; Silicon based nanostructures; Silicon nanostructures; Silicon waveguides; Vapor-phase; Crystal atomic structure; Fabrication; Hydrofluoric acid; Liquids; Nanostructures; Optical resonators; Photonics; Silicon on insulator technology; Stiction; Vapors; Waveguides; Wet etching; Photonic crystals"

We find that the device's finesse, resonant transmission and resonant reflection can be explained with a simple model which allows us to extract the membrane's optical loss.

It shows the strategy of tolerances definition for optomechanical systems. These prescriptions are the baseline for development and tests of VST telescope optomechanic components. The telescope is provided with an active optics control system, so some tolerances may be relaxed, respect to passive systems designs since they can be actively compensated. Gravitational and thermal deformations have been also considered. The design error budget strategy is described. This budget will be upgraded with the achieved budget including measured errors in order to compare them with the prescriptions. The Manufacturing, mounting and alignment tolerances have been evaluated within the whole telescope image quality error budget, in terms of rms spot radius. Since the telescope is seeing limited, effects of atmospheric seeing have also been considered in the error budget in terms of CIR. Do to its large field of view (1 degree square), the VST optical design (optomechanics tolerances included) is the first source of error if compared to a classical telescope design that has a small field of view. The overall optical quality depends also on telescope configuration (ADC and one-lens corrector or two-lens corrector configuration) and on observational zenith angle (0 ÷50°).","CIR; Error budget; Optomechanics tolerances; Performance","Deformation; Gravitation; Mechanics; Optics; Telescopes; CIR; Error budget; Optomechanics tolerances; Error analysis"

The TRO as the central optical unit of the Aladin instrument feeds the optical signals from the laser source to the emitting/receiving telescope, and vice versa, the received back scattered signals from the telescope to the spectrometers for Doppler shift evaluation. Additionally, a calibration branch is supported, which bypasses the telescope (from the laser to the spectrometers) and aims at levelling out the received signals in terms of wavelength and signal height changes due to wavelength and intensity variations of the laser. The TRO makes use of refractive optics (lenses) to a high extend taking advantage of the fact, that the spectral range of the Aladin instrument is narrow (centred at 354.8 nm). The opto-mechanical concept of the TRO features afocal optical groups, which are connected by parallel beams. Extreme requirements have been defined for the TRC on the end-to-end transmission (>= 73%) with an associated effective bandwidth of less than 1 nm over the 200-1100 nm spectral range. A solution to these stringent requirements is addressed in this paper. A further feature of the TRO are two so-called aberration generators on the emitting and calibration branch, with which an artificial astigmatism can be realised for eye safety reasons. A three lens configuration has been designed for the aberration genertor. Its effect on astigmatism is presented. This article also addresses the effort on stray light suppression, which is of high importance for the TRO. The qualification of optical coatings, the integration and test philosophy for the TRO concludes this paper.","Aeolus satellite; Aladin instrument; Lidar; Optical design; Optomechanics","Laser applications; Optical design; Optical signal processing; Transceivers; Weather satellites; Aeolus satellite; Aladin instrument; Optomechanics; Optical radar"

This Global Model should be a dynamical simulation capable to predict the pointing, tracking, guiding and image quality of the GTC system in several simulation scenarios depending of the behavior of each subsystem. It was decided to develop the simulation in the Matlab/Simulink® enviroment. The kernel of the Global Model was a Simulink® model of the telescope mechanics. The model included the structural dynamics, control loops of the main axis (azimuth, elevation and rotators), and load models (wind, gravity, seism). Each component included error sources inherent to it (cogging and ripple on motors, encoding errors, bearing run-out, etc). The model permitted large rotations in elevation axis, which was necessary to test pointing performances. A specific simulation was developed within the project office for the analysis of the image quality of the optical system. It includes polishing defects of the optical surfaces (M1 segments, M2 and M3), low spatial frequency distortions of the optical surfaces (due to fabrication, gravity of instability) and misalignment between the primary mirror segments.","Mechanics; Model; Optomechanics; Simulation; Structure","Bandwidth; Computer simulation; Errors; Finite element method; Image analysis; Optical systems; Sensors; Systems engineering; Gran telescope canarias (GTC); Optical telescopes"

Modern computer graphics software developed for CAD and the entertainment industry has been applied to this problem at Pilkington Optronics as part of the process of integrated optomechanical design. This paper describes the relevant features of the new software packages as applied to the analysis of stray light and presents some results from particular systems. A useful feature of the technique is the use of animation to reduce the dimensionality; these examples cannot be presented here in written form but some simplified examples are available on request on 3.5 inch diskette format.",,"Optomechanics; Stray light; Animation; Computer aided design; Computer graphics; Visualization; Optical systems"

The needed measurements are realized through microfringe interferometric precision with a presently achievable accuracy of the order of 0.01 ppm. Application of such subnanometer standards to x-ray and particulary gamma-ray wavelength measurement requires accurate interferometric angle measurement nowadays effective at the sub-milli-arcsecond level. From results obtained to date, one can infer certain constraints on the future direction of subpicometer interferometry and sub-milli-arcsecond goniometry.",,"Monocrystals; Optomechanics; Sub-milli-arcsecond goniometry; Subpicometer interferometry; Angle measurement; Atoms; Diffraction; Gamma rays; Interferometers; Optics; Precision engineering; Silicon; X ray apparatus"

Currently, zerodur, and silicon carbide are commonly used as the substrate materials of choice for x-ray mirrors, and the required surface finish is achieved through traditional through traditional polishing methods, which are very expensive and time consuming. The cost of instruments for many new applications in the areas of biomedicine, nondestructive testing and space can be greatly reduced by using the replication methods for producing x-ray quality grazing-incidence type mirrors. This paper presents the optical and optomechanical design for a Wolter type I mirror and its mount, and the fabrication methods used to produce a low cost replicated nickel mirror. The finite element analysis (FEA) results for this mirror are also presented. The fabrication steps including the design and nickel and gold plating of the aluminum master mandrel used for the replication are also discussed. A surface finish of 10-15 angstrom was achieved for a mirror with a wall thickness of only 1 mm for such an electroformed mirror. These kind of replicated x-ray mirrors can result in a major saving in the weight as well as cost, while also making the resulting instruments much more compact and rugged.",,"Optomechanics; X ray mirrors; Aluminum; Biomedical equipment; Cost effectiveness; Design; Electroforming; Fabrication; Finite element method; Gold plating; Mirrors; Nickel; Nondestructive examination; X ray apparatus"

Bi-aspheric objectives have been calculated for readout in LaserVision and Compact Disc, and also for writing the information onto the master discs for both systems. An aspheric system for projection television and a zoom lens have also been designed. The fabrication was 'optomechanical': the surfaces were turned and ground to an optical finish on COLATH. The optical elements produced are of diffraction-limited quality. The description of the fabrication includes quality of finish and optical aberrations, the alignment of the refracting surfaces and quality control. Inaccuracies of form of 0. 2 mu m and surface-roughness values of less than 5 nm have been achieved for small areas. Deterioration in quality due to machining marks is negligible.
