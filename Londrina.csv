The combined effects of relative humidity and plasticizer on mechanical properties of starch films were also examined. Water affinities of cassava starch films were affected by hydrophilicity of the plasticizer and its concentration. Films plasticized with glycerol, under all RH conditions, adsorbed more moisture with higher initial adsorption rate, and films with higher plasticizers contents exhibited higher equilibrium moisture contents. Mechanical properties were affected by plasticizing effect, including the water adsorbed, resulting in higher strain and Young's modulus values for starch films and, in all cases, glycerol exerted a more effective plasticization. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Films were characterized by polarized light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermomechanical analysis (TMA), X-ray diffraction, water vapor permeability (WVP) and water sorption isotherms. The polarized light microscopy and DSC data showed that starch gelatinization for film formation was complete. Plasticized films have a homogeneous structure as observed by SEM. At water activities >0.43, glycerol increased the equilibrium moisture content of the films due to its hydrophilic character. X-ray pattern of the yam films could be assigned to a B-type starch; during storage this pattern remained almost the same, however a slight recrystallization process could be observed. Amylopectin retrogradation was not observed by DSC with storage time of the films. Glass transition temperatures of films with glycerol were lower than those of control films as measured by DSC and TMA. WVP of yam starch films increased with the presence of glycerol. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

Kw values were determined in three ranges of relative humidity, RH, (2-33%, 33-64% and 64-90%) and the GAB model was used to fit experimental water sorption isotherms. These data were used to determine the relative influence of the diffusion coefficient of water (Dw) and the average solubility coefficient (over(β, ̄)) of water in the films on the Kw value. In all cases, an increase in Kw values were observed with increasing plasticizer concentration and RH. The Dw, over(β, ̄) and Kw values of films prepared with glycerol were greater than those of films prepared with sorbitol. For high RH, the over(β, ̄) values increased 6-fold for films with glycerol and 7-fold for films with sorbitol, while Dw values did not change significantly. These results indicate that Kw values are dependent on the solubility coefficient (over(β, ̄)) of water in the film, which is not consistent with the proposal that an opening of polymer chains promoted by plasticizers leads to an increase in Dw and Kw. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, their mechanical and moisture barrier properties should be improved. The aim of this work was to enhance these properties by reinforcing the films with cellulose fibers. Besides, the influences of both the solubility coefficient of water in the films (β) and the diffusion coefficient of water vapor through the films (Dw) on the films' water vapor permeability (Kw) were investigated. Films were prepared by the so-called casting technique, from film-forming suspensions of cassava starch, cellulose fibers (1.2 mm long and 0.1 mm of diameter), glycerol and water. The influence of fibers addition on Kw was determined at three relative humidity gradient ranges, ΔRH (2-33%, 33-64% and 64-90%). Films reinforced with cellulose fibers showed higher tensile strength and lower deformation capacity, and presented lower Kw than films without fibers. Kw showed strong dependency of β and Dw, presenting values up to 2-3 times greater at ΔRH = 64-90% than at ΔRH = 33-64%, depending on the film formulation. Therefore, adding cellulose fibers to starch-based films is a viable alternative to improve their mechanical and water barrier properties. Besides, this work showed the importance of determining film's water vapor permeability simulating the real environmental conditions the film will be used. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Hepatic uptake of CA and its effects on hepatic catabolism of L-alanine and glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) activity were also evaluated. CA (1 mM) inhibited about 40% of G-6-Pase activity (p < 0.05) in the microsomal fraction of hepatocytes, but no effect was observed on production of glucose from gluconeogenesis or on L-alanine catabolism, at various concentrations of CA (0.33, 0.5 and 1 mM), in liver perfusion experiments. Since there were indications of a lack of uptake of CA by the liver, it is possible that this compound did not reach sufficiently high intracellular levels to inhibit the target enzyme. Accordingly, intravenous administration of CA also failed to provoke a reduction in blood glucose levels. However, CA did promote a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in the plasma glucose peak at 10 and 15 min during the oral glucose tolerance test, probably by attenuating intestinal glucose absorption, suggesting a possible role for it as a glycaemic index lowering agent and highlighting it as a compound of interest for reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Centrally administered melanotan II (MTII), a synthetic melanocortin 3/4-receptor agonist, decreases adiposity beyond that accountable by food intake decreases. Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) mRNA is expressed on sympathetic nervous system (SNS) outflow neurons to white adipose tissue (WAT) in Siberian hamsters, suggesting a role in lipid mobilization. Therefore, we tested whether third ventricular injections of MTII increased sympathetic drive to WAT and interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) using norepinephrine turnover (NETO) as a measure of sympathetic drive. We also tested for MTII-induced changes in lipolysis-related WAT gene expression (β3-adrenoceptors, hormone sensitive lipase) and IBAT thermogenesis (β3-adrenoceptor, uncoupling protein-1). Finally, we tested whether third ventricularly injected MTII, a highly selective MC4-R agonist (cyclo[β-Ala-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Glu]NH2) increased or agouti-related protein decreased IBAT temperature in hamsters implanted with sc IBAT temperature transponders. Centrally administered MTII provoked differential sympathetic drives to WAT and IBAT (increased inguinal WAT, dorsosubcutaneous WAT and IBAT NETO, but not epididymal WAT and retroperitoneal WAT NETO). MTII also increased circulating concentrations of the lipolytic products free fatty acids and glycerol but not plasma catecholamines, suggesting lipid mobilization via WAT SNS innervation and not via adrenal medullary catecholamines. WAT or IBAT gene expression was largely unaffected by acute MTII treatment, but IBAT temperature was increased by MTII and the MC4-R agonist and decreased by agouti-related protein. Collectively, this is the first demonstration of central melanocortin agonist stimulation of WAT lipolysis through the SNS and confirms melanocortin-induced changes in BAT thermogenesis.

The effects of different amylose quantities (6.3, 15.6 and 25.0g/100g of starch) and glycerol contents (20.0, 32.5 and 45.0 g/100 g of starch) on filmogenic solution were evaluated in barrier and mechanical properties of films. Enrichment of amylose in films formulation produced starches in filmogenic solutions with amylose contents ranging between 25.5%) and 36.6%. Mechanical and barrier properties of cassava starch films were influenced by glycerol and amylose contents (Tukey test,p < 0.05). The enrichment of filmogenic solutions with amylose solution originates stronger and more permeable films. Glycerol behaved as a typical plasticizer in starch films; with increasing glycerol concentration, water vapor permeability, strain at break and puncture deformation increased, and stress at break, Young's modulus and puncture strength decreased. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Film samples were prepared from solutions with 3% of cassava starch, with the addition of 0, 0.10, 0.30 and 0.50 g of fibers/g of starch. The mechanical properties of samples conditioned at different relative humidity (RH) values were determined through tensile and stress relaxation tests. SEM micrographs of the films showed a homogeneous and random distribution of the cellulose fibers, without pores or cracks. Films with fibers were more crystalline and had higher tensile strength and rigidity, but lower elongation capacity. On the other hand, addition of cellulose fibers increased the stability of starch-based films subjected to RH variations, solving a classical problem encountered with this kind of film. Thus, the addition of cellulose fibers to starch-based films is an effective way to prepare stronger and more stable films. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Cassava starch films were prepared with (nanocomposite) and without nanoclay (control) in two steps: firstly the production of extruded pellets and secondly thermo-pressing. The nanocomposite films were prepared via two different methods: in D samples the nanoclay was dispersed in glycerol and subsequently incorporated into the starch; and in ND samples all ingredients were added in a single step before the extrusion. All the composite-films were prepared with cassava starch using 0.25g of glycerol/g of starch and 0.03g of nanoclay/g of starch. Control samples showed VA-type crystallinity induced by the manufacturing process and the nanocomposites presented a semicrystalline and intercalated structure. The nanoclay improved the water vapor barrier properties of the starch film and this effect was more pronounced in D samples, where the water vapor permeability (Kw) was 60% lower than that of the control samples. The Kw reduction was associated with decreases in the effective diffusion coefficient (approximately 61%) and in the coefficient of solubility (approximately 22-32%). On the other hand, the incorporation of nanoclay increased the tensile strength and the rigidity of the films and this effect was more significant when the nanoclay was dispersed in glycerol. Thus, the incorporation of nanoclay into starch-based films is a promising way to manufacture films with better mechanical and water vapor barrier properties. © 2011 Elsevier B.V."

Amylose from yam starch showed the smallest molecular weight among the starches and amylopectin from corn starch the smallest molecular weight. Cassava starch presented a higher amylopectin content, and its gels and films were less strong, more transparent, and more flexible than corn and yam films. Plasticized films of the three starches were more flexible, with a higher strain and lower stress at break when the glycerol content increased. Unplasticized films were brittle and had water vapor permeability values ranging from 6.75 × 10 -10 to 8.33 × 10-10 g m-1 s-1 Pa-1. These values decreased when the glycerol content reached 20 g/100 g of starch because a more compact structure was formed. Then, at a glycerol content of 40 g/100 g of starch, the WVP increased because the film matrixes became less dense."

Low concentrations (nM level) of a phenothiazine compound were detected through impedance spectroscopy. Both negative l,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-3-glycero-[phosphor-rac-(l-glycerol)] (DPPG) and zwitterionic L-α-l,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-3-glycero-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) phospholipids were used to produce the LbL films, whose molecular architecture was monitored combining spectroscopy and microscopy at micro and nanoscales. The sensor array was complemented by Langmuir - Blodgett (LB) monolayers of DPPG and DPPC deposited onto Pt interdigitated electrodes as well. It was found that the distinct molecular architecture presented by both LbL and LB films plays a key role on the sensitivity of the sensor array with the importance of the LbL films being demonstrated by principal component analysis (PCA). © Copyright 2009 American Chemical Society."

ANIMALS: Male albino rats (200-250 g) were used in all experiments. MEASUREMENTS: D-glucose, L-lactate and pyruvate production. RESULTS: In the present study, no differences were found for the rates of glycolysis, as expressed by the areas under the curves, among control (24.2 ± 5.0 mmol/g), leptin (32.0 ± 4.5 mmol/g), glucagon (24.7 ± 3.0 mmol/g), and the leptin + glucagon (23.8 ± 3.4 mmol/g) groups. No difference was found for the rates of glycogenolysis between the control and the leptin perfused livers (15.2 ± 3.9 and 15.0 ± 3.2 mmol/g, respectively). In the presence of glucagon, the areas under the curves for the rate of glycogenolysis rose to 108.6 ± 3.8 mmol/g. When leptin was combined with glucagon, the area under the curve for glycogenolysis was 43.7 ± 4.3 mmol/g. In fact, leptin caused a reduction of almost 60% (P &lt; 0.001) in the rate of glucagon-stimulated glycogenolysis. Under basal conditions, the addition of leptin (100 ng/ml) to the incubation medium did not elicit any alteration in glucose production by isolated hepatocytes. However, in the presence of leptin, the production of glucose from glycerol (2 mM), L-lactate (2 mM). L-alanine (5 mM) and L-glutamine (5 mM) by the isolated hepatocytes was significantly reduced (30%, 30%, 23% and 25%, respectively). The rate of glucose production (glycogenolysis) by isolated hepatocytes was not different between the control and the leptin incubated groups (445.0 ± 91.0 and 428.0 ± 72.0 nmol/106 cells/h, respectively). CONCLUSION: We conclude that leptin per se does not directly affect either liver glycolysis or its glucose production, but a physiological leptin concentration is capable of acutely inducing a direct marked reduction on the rate of glucagon-stimulated glucose production in in situ rat perfused liver. Leptin is also capable of reducing glucose production from different gluconeogenic precursors in isolated hepatocytes."

Incorporation rates of 3H20 into TAG-fatty acids (FAs) in the two adipose tissues and in liver were reduced in HP rats to about 20% and 50%, respectively, of the rates in control rats. In the two experimental groups, glucose was a poor precursor for FA synthesis, contributing only 22.8% of whole-body (carcass plus liver) total FA synthesis in control rats and even less (14%) in HP rats. In contrast to the reduction in FA synthesis, incorporation of 3H20 into TAG-glycerol in HP rats did not differ significantly or was even higher (in epididymal tissue) versus the control level. In all tissues of both HP and control rats, the rate of 14C-glucose incorporation into TAG-glycerol was much higher than the rate of incorporation into FA. Glyceroneogenesis, estimated by subtracting TAG- glycerol synthesis from glucose from the rate obtained with 3H20, was significantly increased in adipose tissue from HP rats, with almost all of the glycerol formed by this route being used to esterify preformed FAs. It is suggested that the increased adipose tissue glyceroneogenesis is important for esterification of diet-derived FA and preservation of body fat stores in rats adapted to the HP diet."

The effects of the components of the mixture on the mechanical properties, water vapor permeability (WVP) and opacity of the films were studied. According to the models generated by the design, the concentration of starch had a positive effect in all properties. The plasticizer glycerol and its interactions with other components had a positive effect on increasing the WVP. The presence of a higher relative concentration of chitosan favored the formation of more rigid and opaque and less permeable films. In general, the concentrations of starch, chitosan and glycerol led to changes in the film properties, potentially affecting their performance.

The influence of temperature and oil:alcohol molar ratio was evaluated using experiment factorial design and response surface methodology. According to the results, the maximum yields of esters were obtained when the temperature was lower than 40 °C and the oil:alcohol molar ratio was higher than 1:7. A membrane separation process was used to separate glycerol from biodiesel after transesterification. The reaction mixture was directly microfiltered after the addition of acidified water without previous settling. Microfiltration runs were performed in batch mode using a 0.2-μm ceramic membrane at 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. bar transmembrane pressures. Membrane performance was evaluated based on the capacity of glycerol retention and on the permeate flux values. The results showed that the water concentration added to the mixture plays an important role in glycerol separation, as well as in the permeate flux, according to the proposed glycerol separation mechanism using ceramic membrane. The use of filtration with ceramic membrane was efficient to remove glycerol from biodiesel, and the permeates obtained for all conditions showed free glycerol values lower than 0.02%, which is the maximum specification limit. © 2011 Elsevier B.V."

The higher lipid content (1.36%) of oat starch compared to other traditional starches could impart more hydrophobic characteristics to its films, thereby increasing stability. The objective of this work was to investigate the behavior of oat starch films (produced by casting) and sheets (produced by extrusion), plasticized with urea, glycerol or sorbitol, and conditioned at 11, 57, 76 and 90% relative humidity (RH). In general, the increase of RH results in a decrease of stress and an increase of strain at break, independent of the type of plasticizer. The Tg of materials plasticized with polyols was similar. The extruded sheets were more permeable to water vapor than the casted films. Films containing urea presented a relative crystallinity (5.14%) four times lower when compared with the other films, but the same behavior was not observed for sheets. The lipid content of oat starch was not high enough to avoid altering of mechanical properties as a function of RH. When the two processes (casting and extrusion) applied for materials production were compared, similar trends were observed on the final effects. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

In both HP-adapted and control rats, in vivo incorporation of 3H2O and [14C]glucose into BAT glyceride-glycerol was much higher than into FA. It could be estimated that most of the glycerol synthetized was used to esterify preformed FA. Glycerol synthesis from nonglucose sources (glyceroneogenesis) was increased in BAT from HP rats, as evidenced by an increased capacity of tissue fragments to incorporate [1-14C]pyruvate into glycerol and by a fourfold increase in the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity, a key glyceroneogenic enzyme. The data suggest that high rates of glyceroneogenesis and of esterification of preformed FA in BAT from HP-adapted rats are essential for preservation of tissue lipid stores, necessary for heat generation when BAT is recruited in nonshivering thermogenesis."

Four different processing techniques: casting; pressing; pressing followed by blowing and extrusion followed by blowing were evaluated. Bioplastics prepared by casting were homogeneous and transparent with lower opacity and water vapor permeability (WVP) values when compared to films prepared by other techniques. Among the cast films studied, those with 3% lipophilic starch, in 1:1 proportions and plasticized with sorbitol, showed lower WVP values and higher tensile strength (TS). Films obtained by pressing and blowing showed little expansion during blow, had cracks in the surface, low TS and higher WVP. These films were the only samples to show crystallinity as determined by thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction.

A method for producing these films is to produce pellets of thermoplastic starch (starch + glycerol) and extrude them again along with PBAT pellets (M1) or extrude the starch granules with PBAT and glycerol pellets (M2), reducing the processing cost. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the method of producing PBAT + starch blends (M1 and M2) on the mechanical, structural, and micro-structural barrier to water vapor of biodegradable films produced by blown extrusion. Films with a higher amount of starch had characteristics similar to those of films with lower concentrations when the blends were prepared by the method M2, probably due to the increased contact area of the starch granules compared to pellets of TPS, allowing greater interaction between starch and PBAT. The method M1 resulted in films with better mechanical properties when the concentration of PBAT was equal to 50%. With increasing concentration of starch (>50%), blends can be prepared with the method M2 (starch granules) in a single extrusion phase without loss of mechanical properties, which can result in lower production cost. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Impairment of energy metabolism is usually coupled to reduction in ATP production, which in turn is expected to lead to several alterations in cell metabolism such as stimulation of glycolysis and inhibition of gluconeogenesis. The present work aimed at finding an answer to the question of how propofol affects energy metabolism-linked parameters in the isolated perfused rat liver. In the fed state, propofol increased glycogenolysis (glucose release), glycolysis (lactate and pyruvate production) and oxygen uptake in the range between 10 and 500 μM. In the liver of fasted rats, propofol up to 100 μM increased oxygen uptake but decreased gluconeogenesis from three different substrates: lactate, alanine and glycerol. When lactate was the substrate 50% inhibition occurred at a propofol concentration of 50 μM. Propofol (100 μM) decreased the ATP content of the liver (-33.3%), increased the AMP content (+25%) and decreased the ATP/ADP and ATP/AMP ratios (49 and 45%, respectively). Most effects of propofol are probably due to impairment of oxidative phosphorylation. Particularly, the combined differential action on oxygen uptake (stimulation) and gluconeogenesis (inhibition) is strongly suggestive of an uncoupling action also under the conditions of the intact cell. This effect, in turn, is consistent with the reported high affinity of the cellular hepatic structure, especially membranes, for propofol."

The experimental technique used was the isolated liver perfusion. Hepatic gluconeogenesis in arthritic rats was generally lower than in normal rats. The difference between normal and arthritic rats depended on the gluconeogenic substrate. In the absence of glucagon the following sequence of decreasing differences was found: alanine (-71.8 per cent) ≃ glutamine (-71.7 per cent) > pyruvate (-60 per cent) > lactate + pyruvate (-44.9 per cent) > xylitol (n.s. = non-significant) ≃ glycerol (n.s.). For most substrates glucagon increased hepatic gluconeogenesis in both normal and arthritic rats. The difference between normal and arthritic rats, however, tended to diminish, as revealed by the data of the following sequence: alanine (-48.9 per cent) ≃ pyruvate (-47.6 per cent) > glutamine (-33.8 per cent) > glycerol (n.s.) ≃ lactate + pyruvate (n.s.) ≃ xylitol (n.s.). The causes for the reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis in arthritic rats are probably related to: (a) lower activities of key enzymes catalyzing most probably steps preceding phosphoenolpyruvate (e.g. phosphoenolpvruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate carboxylase, etc.); (b) a reduced availability of reducing equivalents in the cytosol; (c) specific differences in the situations induced by hormones or by the individual substrates. Since glycaemia is almost normal in chronically arthritic rats, it seems that lower gluconeogenesis is actually adapted to the specific needs of these animals."

To optimize the formulations an experimental design for multicomponent mixtures was used and the assayed formulations were determined by statistical software. Blends and pellets humidity content increased with glycerol concentration. Starch destructuration during the extrusion process was studied by thermal analysis. Films presented homogenous structure, rough surfaces and certain stickiness. They presented different properties, related mainly to the differential characteristics of native and acetylated starches and to hydrophilic character of glycerol. Their mechanical behavior indicated that they are a good option as a food packaging materials since TPS films resulted enough resistant to protect the product and flexible to resist moderate deformations. Besides, the use of acetylated starch in the formulations enhanced film resistance and reduced their WVP, despite of its low modification degree. The storage of the films under controlled conditions increased their stiffness, while their flexibility and WVP were reduced. Plasticizer migration towards the matrix surface was observed in stored films. Films resulted stable till aw = 0.7 and due to their selective gaseous permeability they are useful to package products susceptible to oxidation or to control vegetable respiration and senescence.© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the in vivo toxicity induced by infusion of PTX and CREL and to investigate the involvement of oxidative stress as a potential mechanism for this toxicity. We treated male Wistar rats with PTX and/or CREL for 1h using human-equivalent doses (PTX+CREL/ethanol+NaCl 175mg/m2 or CREL+ethanol+NaCl) and sacrificed immediately or 24h after these drug infusions to systemic biochemical evaluations. Hidrosoluble vitamin E (vitE, Trolox) was added as a control in some groups. The oxidative profile was determined by measuring erythrocyte and plasma lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, red blood cell (RBC) counts, hemoglobin profile, plasma total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), plasma lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide levels and malondialdehyde levels. Our findings showed that CREL infusion triggered immediate high plasma lipid peroxidation and augmented TRAP, while PTX caused immediate TRAP consumption and metahemoglobin formation. Pronounced oxidative effects were detected 24h after infusion, when CREL treatment enhanced RBC counts and plasma lipid peroxidation, increased catalase activity, and decreased TRAP levels. On the other hand, after 24h, PTX-infused rats showed reduced catalase activity and reduced metahemoglobin levels. These data indicate the existence of a continuous oxidative stress generation during CREL-PTX treatment and highlight CREL as primarily responsible for the in vivo oxidative damage to RBCs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

Palm oil ranks first in the world in terms of edible oil production owing to its low cost. The aim of this study was to propose a new methodology to produce diacylglycerol by hydrolysis of palm oil using Lipozyme RM IM commercial lipase as a catalyst under ultrasound irradiation. The reactions were carried out at 55°C with two different methods. First, the reaction system was exposed to ultrasonic waves for the whole reaction time, which led to enzymatic inactivation and water evaporation. Ultrasound was then used to promote emulsification of the water/oil system before the hydrolysis reaction, avoiding contact between the probe and the enzymes. An experimental design was used to optimize the ultrasound-related parameters and maximize the hydrolysis rate, and in these conditions, with a change in equilibrium, DAG production was evaluated. Better reaction conditions were achieved for the second method: 11.20 wt.% (water + oil mass) water content, 1.36 wt.% (water + oil mass) enzyme load, 12 h of reaction time, 1.2 min and 200 W of exposure to ultrasound.

These compounds (2% w/w) were added to the starch/PBAT (55:45) mixture after dispersion on glycerol. More rigid films, with greater tensile strength (9.82±0.45MPa), were produced when 2.0% CA was used. The opposite, little homogeneity and poor tensile strength (0.77±0.12MPa) and elongation (2.67±0.67%) were found in films produced using 2.0% MA. Barrier properties to water vapour were improved by compatibilisers. FTIR analysis showed that CA and MA were able to promote esterification/transesterification reactions. Blends containing CA also showed better phase compatibilisation in the scanning electron microscopic images. It was found that in mixtures containing MA, the process and the concentration of this reagent need to be adapted to produce films with improved properties. © 2011 The Authors.

The exposure of protocorms to 2. M glycerol osmoprotective solution for 20. min followed by 10. min in PVS2 vitrification solution with 1% phloroglucinol resulted in the highest protocorm recovery and survival (68%). A positive effect of phloroglucinol was observed when combined with glycerol and PVS2. Phloroglucinol added at 1% provided an increase of over 100% in protocorm recovery and survival as compared to the same treatment without phloroglucinol. However, when sucrose was added to treatments, a negative effect was observed with a reduction in survival by 90%. Protocorms that survived cryopreservation were successfully regenerated into plants and acclimatized with 100% survival in greenhouse. Survival of cryopreserved D. nobile protocorms was a determining factor for seedling survival and growth into normal and fully functional plants.

These sheets were coated with cross-linked chitosan by two different methods: spraying and immersion. The coated sheets presented a more irregular surface than uncoated samples, which was associated with the chitosan reticulation. The chitosan coating reduced the water solubility and the water vapor permeability of the sheets due to being less hygroscopic. Coated sheets were more rigid and had higher tensile strength than uncoated sheets, because the cross-linking joins the macromolecules covalently, reducing the mobility of the chains. Higher glycerol concentration in the TPS increased the elongation at break due to the glycerol plasticizing effect. Coating by spraying was more effective at changing the sheet properties than coating by immersion, and this technique can be used to reduce the hydrophilic character of biodegradable films, allowing their use as packaging materials. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Experiments were done in the isolated perfused rat liver. n-Propyl gallate inhibited gluconeogenesis and stimulated oxygen uptake at concentrations up to 200 μM. The inhibitory effects on lactate gluconeogenesis (ED50 86.4 μM) and alanine gluconeogenesis were considerably more pronounced than those on glycerol and fructose gluconeogenesis. n-Propyl gallate also stimulated oxygen uptake in both the mitochondrial (63%) and microsomal (37%) electron transport chains. The first one is due mainly to the oxidation of n-propanol, as a metabolite of the first step of n-propyl gallate transformation. The second one results from a direct stimulation of the microsomal electron transport chain. n-Propyl gallate inhibited pyruvate carboxylation (ED50 142.2 μM) in consequence of an inhibition of pyruvate transport into the mitochondria an effect not found for gallic acid. This is probably the main cause for glucose output inhibition. Secondary causes are (1) deviation of intermediates for the production of NADPH to be used in microsomal electron transport; (2) deviation of glucose 6-phosphate for glucuronidation reactions; (3) gluconeogenesis inhibition by n-propanol, produced intracellularly from n-propyl gallate. Inhibition of mitochondrial energy metabolism is not significant in the range up to 200 μM, as indicated by the very small effect on the cellular ATP levels (5% decreased). n-Propyl gallate can be considered a kind of metabolic effector, whose actions on the liver metabolism are relatively mild although they can become harmful for the organ and the whole organism at high doses and concentrations. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The interaction between the starch/PBAT and the TA has a positive effect on the tensile strength and puncture force. Additionally, greater proportions of TA increased Young's modulus. The starch + PBAT/TA and Gly/TA interactions contributed to a reduction in the water vapour permeability of the films. The inclusion of TA did not change the crystallinity of the samples. Formulations with intermediate proportions of TA (0.8 g/100 g) were shown to produce the best compatibilising effect.

Cachexia parameters and tumour mass also were investigated. In general, especially on day 14 after implantation of tumour, there was reduction of body mass, gastrocnemius muscle mass, food intake and glycemia and increase of blood triacylglycerol, free fatty acids, lactate and urea, compared with free-fed controls rats. These changes did not occur in pair-fed control, except a slight reduction of glycemia. Pair-fed control showed no significant changes in blood cholesterol and glycerol in comparison with free-fed control, although there was reduction of cholesterol and increase of blood glycerol on day 14 after tumour implantation compared with pair-fed control. The results demonstrate that, besides the characteristic signs of the cachexia syndrome such as anorexia, weight loss and muscle catabolism, Walker-256 tumour-bearing rats show several blood metabolic alterations, some of which begin as early as day 5 after implantation of tumour, and are accentuated during the development of cachexia. Evidence that the alterations of blood metabolic parameters of tumour-bearing rats were not found in pair-fed control indicate that they were not caused by decreased food intake. These changes were probably mediated by factors produced by tumour or host tissue in response to the presence of tumour. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Films were manufactured from nine starch/xanthan/nanoclay combinations, containing glycerol as plasticizer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the starch-xanthan extruded films showed reticulated surface and smooth interior, indicating that the gum was mostly concentrated on the surface of the films, while starch/xanthan/nanoclays films showed a more homogeneous surface, suggesting that the introduction of nanoclays provided a better biopolymeric interaction. In general, nanoclays addition (2.5 - 5.0, w%) generated more transparent and resistant films, with lower water vapor permeabilities and lower water sorption capacities and xanthan gum addition improved the elongation of starch films."

The study involved 27 lambs aged 90 days, having an average initial weight of 26.33 ± 0.15 kg. Lambs were randomly distributed into a control group and groups with diets containing 15 and 30% glycerin in the total feed. Diet was formulated with 40% roughage and 60% concentrate. The experimental design was completely randomized, and the production performance and carcass characteristics were analyzed by analysis of variance, and the subjective carcass characteristics, by general linear models. The daily average gain was 0.21, 0.24 and 0.23 kg/day; feeding conversion was 6.39, 5.73 and 5.92 kg of diet/kg BW for control animals, and those fed with 15 or 30% glycerin, respectively, without treatment differences. Lambs were slaughtered, weighing 34 to 36 kg, and average weight of the cold carcass and commercial carcass yield were evaluated. The results were, respectively, 15.97 kg and 49.18%, for control, 15.96 kg and 48.31% for animals fed with 15% glycerin, and 15.79 kg and 47.87% for those treated with 30% glycerin, with no treatment effects.

The influence of composition on mechanical properties, water vapour transmission rate (WVTR), water saturation, and aqueous dissolution of the films was analysed. The thermal stability of the mixture (polymer:plasticizer, 1:1) was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In general, all the properties were affected by the plasticizers. The plasticized films showed lower strength and a higher percentage of elongation (%E), in the following order: G > PEG-400 > unplasticized film. The total WVTR increased with Ch concentration, with a different WVTR profile for Ch and N-CMCh. While the PEG-400 addition did not significantly modify the WVTR profile of films, the glycerol enhanced the transport of water vapour through both polymers. The plasticizer addition increased the time of water film saturation, in the following order: G > PEG-400 > unplasticized film; this was more pronounced in the N-CMCh films, probably due to the formation of hydrogen bonds.

IIH was obtained by an ip injection of regular insulin (1 U/kg). Thus, 150 min after insulin administration the rats received an ip injection of glycerol + L-lactate + L-alanine + L-glutamine (each 100 mg/kg). In these experiments control groups, which received saline, glucose or isolated precursors (100 mg/kg), were employed. Glycemia was measured 30 min later, i.e., 180 min after insulin injection. The results showed that the combined administration of gluconeogenic precursors is more efficient than that of glucose itself to promote glycemia recovery. Since, the blood levels of hepatic glucose precursors were decreased (glycerol, L-lactate and L-alanine) or maintained (L-glutamine) during IIH, the ability of the liver to produce glucose from these gluconeogenic substrates was investigated. The results showed that the maximal capacity of the liver to produce glucose from glycerol (2 mM), L-lactate (2 mM), L-alanine (5 mM) and L-glutamine (5mM) was increased. To L-alanine and L-glutamine, not only the glucose production was increased (P < 0.05) but also the production of L-lactate, pyruvate and urea. Therefore, the results suggest that the decreased availability of glucose precursors, promoted by insulin administration, limits the participation of hepatic gluconeogenesis to glycemia recovery. However, the administration of gluconeogenic precursors could overcome this limitation and promote better glycemia recovery than glucose itself."

However, catalytic reforming technologies face a number of technical and scientific challenges involving the quality of raw materials, conversion efficiency, and safety issues in the integration of systems of H2 production, purification and use, among others. Glycerol is a versatile raw material for H2 production because it is the main by-product of biodiesel production, which a few years ago was consolidated in the world energy matrix and whose production continues to grow in the main consumer markets. Moreover, it has the noteworthy characteristic of decentralized production, which is directly reflected in its easy use.

The experiments were carried out with tubular α-Al2O3/TiO2 membranes with average pore diameter of 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05μm and 20kDa. The experiments used the reaction mixture with mass concentrations of acidified water of 10%, 20% and 30%, transmembrane pressures of 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0bar and temperature at 50°C. By using the mass concentration of 20% acidified water the separation was efficient, but the fouling of the retained phase on the membrane surface led to a sharp reduction of flux over the filtration time. The mass concentration of 30% was excessive and in most experiments the aqueous phase containing glycerol has permeated through the membrane. The addition of 10% of acidified water, besides reducing the fouling on the membrane promoted the retention of aqueous phase containing glycerol, so that the permeate had free glycerol content below 0.02%, maximum value specified for commercialization. The glycerol separation through ultrafiltration is advantageous once it eliminates the settling step and reduces the amount of water used for washing. The properties of the produced biodiesel have met the standards required for commercialization. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

HELAC group showed lower fasting glycemia (p&lt;0.05). In contrast, livers from HELAC group showed higher (p&lt;0.05) glucose production from L-alanine (5 mM). This effect was mediated, at least part of it, by an activation of the catabolism of L-alanine inferred by the increased hepatic urea (p&lt;0.05) and L-lactate (p&lt;0.05) production. Differently of L-alanine, the glucose production from L-glutamine (5 mM), L-lactate (2 mM) and glycerol (2 mM) was similar (Control group vs. HELAC group). In addition, the HELAC treatment did not change the glucose uptake in soleus muscles, inferred by the incorporation of [14C]-glucose to glycogen (glycogen synthesis) and [14C]-lactate production.

The addition of 1 to 5% potassium sorbate as plasticizer agent of films in place of glycerol did not alter the film mechanical properties and a sorbate concentration greater or equal than 3% reduced the opacity, although increasing the water vapor permeability. The films could be used as active packaging for fresh food pasta, since they remained integral and easy to handle after application. The rice flour was shown to be an excellent material for the formulation of biodegradable films, since it is a low-cost raw material from a renewable source.

Hepatic gluconeogenesis from L-alanine was absent in rats with diabetes induced by STZ or alloxan. STZ-diabetic rats also shown this metabolic change when the period of diabetes was prolonged. It was concluded that this effect may be partly at least, the consequence of an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio in the diabetic rat liver, which indicates that the cytosolic redox potential is favorable to pyruvate conversion to L-lactate but not to glucose. However, considering that glucose production from pyruvate, L-lactate, glycerol and sorbitol was not affected by the diabetic condition, the rate of conversion of L-alanine to pyruvate can contribute to the lack of gluconeogenesis when this amino acid was employed as a substrate."

In recent years, with advances in molecular techniques, several studies have shown that these bacteria have high levels of genetic diversity, resulting in taxonomic reclassifications and descriptions of new species. However, despite the advances achieved, highly conserved 16S ribosomal genes (16S rRNA) do not elucidate differences between species of several genera, including the genus Bradyrhizobium. Other methodologies, such as multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA), have been used in such cases, with good results. In this study, three strains (SEMIAs 690T, 6387 and 6428) of the genus Bradyrhizobium, isolated from nitrogen-fixing nodules of Centrosema and Acacia species, without clear taxonomic positions, were studied. These strains differed from genetically closely related species according to the results of MLSA of four housekeeping genes (dnaK, glnII, gyrB and recA) and nucleotide identities of the concatenated genes with those of related species ranged from 87.8 % to 95.7 %, being highest with Bradyrhizobium elkanii. DNA–DNA hybridization (less than 32 % DNA relatedness) and average nucleotide identity values of the whole genomes (less than 90.5 %) indicated that these strains represented a novel species, and phenotypic traits were determined. Our data supported the description of the SEMIA strains as Bradyrhizobium viridifuturi sp. nov., and SEMIA 690T (=CNPSo 991T= C 100aT=BR 1804T=LMG 28866T), isolated from Centrosema pubescens, was chosen as type strain. © 2015 IUMS."

The extender type used to freeze sperm is important to avoid spermatozoal membrane damage and to preserve semen quality after cryopreservation. The objective of this study was to verify the effects of a commercial bovine extender (Bovimix®; Nutricell, Campinas) and a traditional TRIS-citric acid-glucose-egg yolk-7% glycerol extender on cryopreservation of canine epididymal sperm. The testes of 13 adult dogs were kept at 5°C for 24 h in saline solution, and epididymal sperm was recovered in Ringers solution without lactate and were evaluated for motility. Samples with ≥80% motility were pooled and then divided before dilution and packaging in 0.5 ml plastic straws, equilibration at 4°C for 1 h, freezing in nitrogen vapour for 20 min and storing at -196°C. The straws were thawed at 56°C for 10 s and were evaluated for motility by computer assisted analysis (CASA). The semen parameters, sperm movement index, linearity, total motility and rapid progressive motility were statistically higher in Bovimix® than TRIS. In contrast, amplitude of lateral head displacement, slow sperm and static sperm were lower in Bovimix®. Despite the high percentage of sperm defects in epididymal cells, regardless of the extender, we concluded that Bovimix® is a viable alternative for the freezing of canine epididymal sperm. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."

For this purpose, 24-h fasted rats that received intraperitoneal (ip) regular insulin (1.0 U kg-1) or saline were compared. The studies were performed 30 min after insulin (IIH group) or saline (COG group) injection. For gluconeogenesis studies, livers from the IIH and COG groups were perfused with increasing concentrations (from basal blood concentrations until saturating concentration) of glycerol, L-lactate (Lac) or pyruvate (Pyr). Livers of the IIH group showed maintained efficiency to produce glucose from glycerol and higher efficiency to produce glucose from Lac and Pyr. In agreement with these results the oral administration of glycerol (100 mg kg-1), Lac (100 mg kg-1), Pyr (100 mg kg-1) or glycerol (10 mg kg -1) + Lac (100 mg kg-1) + Pyr (100 mg kg-1) promoted glycaemia recovery. It can be inferred that the increased portal availability of Lac, Pyr and glycerol could help glycaemia recovery by a mechanism mediated, partly at least, by a maintained (glycerol) or increased (Lac and Pyr) hepatic efficiency to produce glucose.

Leptin or insulin alone decreased (p &lt; 0.05) the activation of hepatic glucose, L-lactate and urea production from L-alanine. However, the hepatic glucose production was not modified if leptin was combined with insulin. These results indicated that both, i.e. leptin and insulin, could promote a non-additive reduction in the rate of catabolism of L-alanine. However, in contrast with insulin (p &lt; 0.05), leptin did not inhibit the activation of hepatic glucose production from pyruvate or glycerol. On the other hand, activation of hepatic production of acetoacetate and β- hydroxybutyrate from octanoate was not affected by leptin or insulin. Thus, our data demonstrate that the acute effect of leptin on hepatic metabolism was partially similar to insulin (activation of glucose production from L-alanine and activation of acetoacetate or β-hydroxybutyrate production from octanoate) and partially different from insulin (activation of glucose production from pyruvate or glycerol).

The binodal curves for biodiesel + methanol + glycerol, biodiesel + ethanol + glycerol, biodiesel + methanol + soybean oil and biodiesel + ethanol + soybean oil systems were obtained at two different temperatures by titration. An Othmer-type ebulliometer was used for vapor-liquid equilibrium measurements at pressures ranging from 14.0 kPa to 92.0 kPa. Binodals curves (LLE) indicated that the temperature range used in this study has no effect on the immiscibility region for the biodiesel + methanol + soybean oil system. By contrast, for the biodiesel + ethanol + soybean oil system, the immiscibility region was larger at the lower temperature. For the vapor-liquid equilibrium data, the results showed that the addition of glycerol to the biodiesel + ethanol binary system does not significantly affect the boiling temperature of the system while with the addition of methanol to the biodiesel + soybean oil system the boiling temperatures of the ternary mixture are reduced.

These films were produced by casting and by extrusion from six different starch-xanthan gum combinations (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10% w/w), containing glycerol as plasticizer (20% w/w) and were also characterized according to their microstructure, optical, mechanical, and barrier properties. Scanning electron microscopy of the starch-xanthan gum extruded films showed reticulated surface and smooth interior, suggesting that xanthan was driven to the surface and gelatinized starch to the interior of the films during extrusion. Films manufactured by casting were entirely homogeneous. In general, casted films presented lower opacity and water vapor permeability and higher stress at break than films manufactured by extrusion. Xanthan gum addition affected mechanical properties of starch films, improving their stress and strain at break, especially for extruded samples, but these properties did not show stability at different RH conditions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

The objective of this work was the preparation of reactive thermoplastic starch in the presence of glycerol and with different amounts of maleic anhydride (MA) and free-radical initiator, in order to improve processability and reactivity. The concentration of MA added varied from 2 to 6 wt% (of starch + glycerol), and the free-radical initiator, 2,5-bis(tert-butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane, also called Luperox 101, varied from 0.1 to 0.5 wt% (of starch + glycerol). Characterization of maleated thermoplastic starch was performed using dynamic light scattering and thermal analysis. Further, proof of chemically modified extrudate was determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and by soxhlet extraction with acetone. The modified high amylose corn starch (20 or 30% glycerol) could be pelletized and gave pellets that were more transparent than thermoplastic starches not modified with maleic anhydride. There was negligible change in hydrodynamic radius as the percentage of maleic anhydride increased. However, as the percentage of Luperox 101 increased, the hydrodynamic radius decreased. It could be inferred that the molecular weight decreased as the percentage of free-radical initiator increased. Using the maximum temperature in the extrusion process of 165 °C instead of 135 °C caused a decrease in the hydrodynamic radius, due to the high influence of the temperature profile on the molecular weight of the thermoplastic starch. The MTPS samples presented higher melting temperatures compared to TPS samples. The soxhlet studies indicated that the plasticizer, glycerol, was chemically linked to the starch. Using the maximum temperature of 165 °C versus 135 °C in the extrusion temperature profile resulted in more interaction between glycerol and starch. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

Thus, finding a use for the extracted sericin as a biopolymer film will create added value product which will benefit both the economy and society. The films were manufactured with silk sericin, using different dimethylolurea (DMU) concentrations as cross-linking agent and glycerol as plasticizer. Sericin films produced by crosslinking method were light yellow, homogeneous, transparent and visually attractive. The average film thickness was 0.10 ± 0.02 mm. The biofilms show low water solubility (up to 30% of total dry mass), good tension strength and high elongation ability. The water vapor permeability is moderate, typical of highly hydrophilic films. Structural transformations in silk sericin films were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflection (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy and Xray diffraction. This resulted in aggregated β-sheet structure (peak at 1616 cm-1 in the amide I absorption) by FTIR studies and increasing the DMU concentration in film decreased the peak intensity at 2θ = 20°. Sericin-based film properties are dependent on components used to form film, which can used to tailor the desired film flexibility and minimize permeability of films. © 2011, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l."

For this purpose, we used an experimental model in which IIH was obtained by administering an IP injection of a pharmacological dose (1 U/kg) of regular insulin to rats that had been deprived of food for a period of six hours. This experimental model is suitable to study the simultaneous participation of glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis in the defense against IIH. The livers of IIH rats showed insignificant changes in the glycogen concentration, total phosphorylase, active phosphorylase, and percent of active phosphorylase. Our results also indicated that the livers of IIH rats that received the concentration of l-alanine, l-glutamine, l-lactate, or glycerol found in the blood during IIH (basal values) showed negligible glucose production. Nonetheless, glucose, urea, and pyruvate production increased (P < 0.05) if the livers were perfused with a saturating concentration of gluconeogenic precursors. In agreement with these results, IIH rats that received intragastric l-alanine, l-glutamine, or l-lactate showed increased (P < 0.05) glycemia 30 min after the administration of these substances. However, when using glycerol, higher glycemia (P < 0.05) was observed at 2 and 5 min, but not 30 min after the administration of this hepatic gluconeogenic precursor. Thus, we can conclude that the oral availability of gluconeogenic precursors could allow for their use as important antidote in the defense against IIH. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The effects of TA, glycerol and starch + PBAT on the mechanical, optical and structural properties of the films were evaluated, with formulations based in a constrained mixture design. Tartaric acid acts as a compatibiliser and promotes the acid hydrolysis of starch chains. These two functions explain the observed film resistance and opacity. TA reduced the weight loss in water. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that TA reduces the interfacial tension between the polymeric phases, resulting in more homogeneous films. Nuclear magnetic resonance (13C CPMAS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) suggest that tartaric acid is able to react with the hydroxyl groups of the starch by esterification/ transesterification reactions, confirming its role as a compatibiliser.

In experiment I, a digestibility assay was conducted using 32 crossbred piglets (19.20±1.52 kg). The experimental unit consisted of one pig, with a total of four experimental units per diet. The glycerine levels used in the digestibility assay were 4, 8, and 12% of the basal diet (corn + soybean based). The digestible (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) values of glycerine were estimated by regression of DE and ME intake (kcal/kg) vs. glycerine intake (kg). The values (as-fed basis) of DE and ME (kcal/kg) obtained were: CGS = 5,070 and 4,556; CGA = 5,143 and 4,488, respectively. The results indicate that these two types of glycerine are a highly-available energy source for the feeding of piglets (15-30 kg). In experiment II, 90 piglets (BW = 15.18±0.67 to 30.28±1.68 kg), were allotted in a completely randomized design in 2 × 4 factorial arrangement, with of two types of crude glycerine (CGS and CGA) and four inclusion levels (3, 6, 9, and 12%). Five experimental units (pens with two pigs) were used for each level of crude glycerine, resulting in five replicates per treatment in the diet. Additionally, a control diet containing no glycerine (0%) was formulated. There was no interaction between levels of CG and types of crude glycerine, and the regression analysis indicates no effects of crude glycerine inclusion on performance and plasma variables. The results suggest that it is feasible to use up to 12% of both tyes of crude glycerine (obtained from soybean oil and mixed) in the diet for piglets without impairing performance, in addition to promoting a reduction of about 11% in the cost with feeding. © 2012 Sociedade Brasileira de Zootecnia."

For this purpose, we employed swimming rats (2.5% body weight extra load attached to the tail, at 24°C) using a favorable condition to measure hepatic glycogenolysis (fed rats) and a favorable condition to measure hepatic gluconeogenesis (fasted rats). This experimental approach permits us to compare the contribution of hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to glucose changes for a specific schedule of exercise. The animals were investigated at rest, after 5 minutes of swimming and after swimming to exhaustion. Our results show that hepatic glycogen has a crucial role to determine hyperglycemia during exercise. In contrast, hypoglycemia developed during exercise when glycogen was depleted. However, the ability of the liver to produce glucose from L-lactate, glycerol and L-glutamine was increased during exercise. Taken together, these findings suggest that the hepatic capacity to produce glucose from gluconeogenic substrates (except for L-alanine) was increased when hepatic glycogen stores were depleted. Thus, the increased capacity to produce glucose shown by livers from exercising rats must to be an important metabolic adaptation to protect against severe hypoglycemia."

However, it is necessary to determine the nutritional value of neutral semi-purified glycerin (NSPG). In this study two experiments were carried out to determine the nutritional value, evaluated the performance and economic feasibility of starting piglets fed on neutral semi-purified glycerin. A digestibility trial (Experiment I) was conducted using 30 crossbred barrows with an initial average body weight of 42.91±1.58 kg. The glycerin levels used in the digestibility assay were 4, 8, 12 and 16% of the basal diet (corn + soybean meal based). The digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable (ME) energy values of glycerin were estimated by regression of DE and ME (kcal/kg) intake associated with glycerin vs. glycerin intake (kg). The values (as-fed-basis) of DE and ME (kcal/ kg) obtained were 3,298 and 2,531, respectively. In Experiment II, 100 piglets (50 gilts and 50 barrows) with BW = 15.14±0.06 to 30.28±0.65 were allotted in a randomized design using four inclusion levels (3.5, 7.0, 10.5 and 14%) of NSPG. There were ten replicates with two piglets per experimental unit. Additionally, a control diet containing no glycerin (0%) was formulated. The results show it is feasible to use up to 14% NSPG in piglet feed without impairing performance and plasma chemistry."

Total RNA was extracted from the breast muscle, and cDNA was amplified using real-time PCR with primers specific to the examined genes.3. Quail fed the diet with 12% glycerol supplementation presented higher growth hormone (GH) mRNA expression than did those fed 0% glycerol. Supplementation with 12% glycerol negatively influenced IGF-I mRNA expression and reduced ANT mRNA expression in comparison with the treatment with no glycerol. COX III mRNA expression in the pectoralis superficialis muscle was decreased by 26% in quail fed 12% glycerol compared with those fed 0 and 4% glycerol.4. There was no difference in UCP mRNA expression between quail fed 0 and 4% glycerol; however, UCP expression was reduced (73%) in birds fed the 12% glycerol diet compared with the level in those fed the 4% glycerol diet.5. The inclusion of 4% glycerol in the diet produced results similar to those of the diet with no glycerol. Based on quail performance and the expression of the GH, IGF-I, ANT, COX III and UCP genes, 4% glycerol can be used in quail feeding without any harmful effects. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Six fermenters (1,223 ± 21 ml) were used in a replicated 3x3 Latin square arrangement with three periods of 10 d each, with 7 d for diet adaptation and 3 d for sample collections. All diets contained 75% concentrate and three dietary glycerin levels (0, 15, and 30% on dry matter basis), totaling six replicates per treatment. Fermenters were fed 72 g of dry matter/d equally divided in two meals/d, at 0800 and 2000 h. Solid and liquid dilution rates were adjusted daily to 5.5 and 11%/h, respectively. On d 8, 9, and 10, samples of 500 ml of solid and liquid digesta effluent were mixed, homogenized, and stored at -20°C. Subsamples of 10 ml were collected and preserved with 0.2 mL of a 50% H2SO4 solution for later determination of NH3-N and volatile fatty acids. Microbial biomass was isolated from fermenters for chemical analysis at the end of each experimental period. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure in SAS with α = 0.05. Glycerin levels did not affect apparent digestibility of DM (PLin. = 0.13; PQuad. = 0.40), OM (PLin. = 0.72; PQuad. = 0.15), NDF (PLin. = 0.38; PQuad. = 0.50) and ADF (PLin. = 0.91; PQuad. = 0.18). Also, glycerin inclusion did not affect true digestibility of DM (PLin. = 0.35; PQuad. = 0.48), and OM (PLin. = 0.08; PQuad. = 0.19). Concentrations of propionate (P &lt; 0.01) and total volatile fatty acids (P &lt; 0.01) increased linearly and concentrations of acetate (P &lt; 0.01), butyrate (P = 0.01), iso-valerate (P &lt; 0.01), and total branched-chain volatile fatty acids, as well as the acetate: propionate ratio (P &lt; 0.01) decreased with glycerin inclusion. Linear increases on NH3-N concentration in digesta effluent (P &lt; 0.01) and on NH3-N flow (P &lt; 0.01) were observed due to glycerin inclusion in the diets. Crude protein digestibility (P = 0.04) and microbial N flow (P = 0.04) were greater in the control treatment compared with the other treatments and responded quadratically with glycerin inclusion. Furthermore, the inclusion of glycerin linearly decreased (P = 0.02) nonammonia N flow. Glycerin levels did not affect the flows of total N (PLin. = 0.79; PQuad. = 0.35), and dietary N (PLin. = 0.99; PQuad. = 0.07), as well as microbial efficiency (PLin. = 0.09; PQuad. = 0.07). These results suggest that partially replacing dry ground corn with glycerin may change ruminal fermentation, by increasing total volatile fatty acids, and propionate concentration without affecting microbial efficiency, which may improve glucogenic potential of beef cattle diets. © 2015 Del Bianco Benedeti et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited."

Moreover, considering that the main aspect of insulin resistance in liver is a process of glucose overproduction from gluconeogenesis, we investigated if this metabolic change also shows temporal sequence. For this purpose, a well-established experimental model of insulin resistance induced by high-fat diet (HFD) was used. The mice received HFD (HFD group) or standard diet (COG group) for 1, 7, 14 or 56days. The HFD group showed increased (P<0.05 versus COG) epididymal, retroperitoneal and inguinal fat weight from days 1 to 56. In agreement with these results, the HFD group also showed higher body weight (P<0.05 versus COG) from days 7 to 56. Moreover, the changes induced by HFD on liver gluconeogenesis were progressive because the increment (P<0.05 versus COG) in glucose production from l-lactate, glycerol, l-alanine and l-glutamine occurred 7, 14, 56 and 56 days after the introduction of the HFD schedule, respectively. Furthermore, glycaemia and cholesterolemia increased (P<0.05 versus COG) 14days after starting the HFD schedule. Taken together, the results suggest that the intensification of liver gluconeogenesis induced by an HFD is not a synchronous 'all-or-nothing process' but is specific for each gluconeogenic substrate and is integrated in a temporal manner with the progressive augmentation of fasting glycaemia. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

From the mechanical tension tests, the extruded strands containing fatty acids differed significantly from the standard one, it was not clear the possibility to establish a comparison between the mechanical properties of the extruded strands and the formation of films. The rheological tests indicated that the polymer blends presented the desired viscoelastic characteristics for the film formation by blown extrusion. © 2011 Society of Plastics Engineers."

A single screw extruder was used to produce the starch - monoglyceride complex before film production and this process was effective to inhibit the phase separation in films. The addition of the hydrophobic compound reduced hydrophobicity, transparency and water vapor permeability of films. This later value for starch-glycerol film (1.7 × 10-10 g Pa-1 s-1 m-1) was higher than starch (1.2 × 10-10 g Pa-1 s-1 m-1) and monoglyceride-starch films (1.0 × 10-10 g Pa-1 s-1 m-1). Films containing glycerol had higher relative crystallinity (B and VH) with a slight increase at higher RH values, while for monoglyceride films, the crystallinity was constant. Monoglyceride-starch films presented poor mechanical properties when compared to glycerol-starch ones but they presented a stable behavior under different relative humidities."

For this purpose, a condition of hyperinsulinemia/hypoglycaemia was obtained with an intraperitoneal (ip) injection of regular insulin (1.0 U kg -1). Control group (COG group) received ip saline. The studies were performed 30 min after insulin (IIH group) or saline (COG group) injection. The livers from IIH and COG rats were perfused with L-alanine (5 mM), L-lactate (2 mM), L-glutamine (10 mM) or glycerol (2 mM). Hepatic glucose, L-lactate and pyruvate production from L-alanine was not affected by IIH. In agreement with this result, the hepatic ability in producing glucose from L-lactate or glycerol remained unchanged (IIH group vs. COG group). However, livers from IIH rats showed higher glucose production from L-glutamine than livers from COG rats and, in the IIH rats, the production of glucose from L-glutamine was higher than that from L-alanine. The higher glucose production in livers from the IIH group, when compared with the COG group was due to its entrance further on gluconeogenic pathway. Taken together, the results suggest that L-glutamine is better than L-alanine, as gluconeogenic substrate in livers of hypoglyceaemic weaned rats. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd."

The main purpose was to verify if oxalate is also active in intact organs as demonstrated in isolated cells. The results revealed that the action of oxalate in the perfused liver resembles only partially that observed in isolated hepatocytes. In the perfused liver, oxalate inhibited gluconeogenesis from alanine, pyruvate and lactate, inhibited glycolysis and stimulated glycogenolysis. These observations confirm previous measurements with isolated hepatocytes. However, additional effects, not observed in isolated hepatocytes, were found. In the perfused liver, oxalate stimulated glucose production from dihydroxyacetone, glycerol or sorbitol. Moreover, the effects of oxalate in the perfused rat liver occurred at concentrations well above those reported for isolated hepatocytes, revealing that the compound is less toxic in the intact tissue. In vivo, the metabolic effects reported here can only be expected to occur at supra-physiological concentrations of oxalate, as in the case of a chronic renal failure.

It was evaluated the influence of oil quality on the biodiesel and glycerol separation by ultrafiltration. The experiments were carried out with tubular a-Al2O3/TiO2 membranes with average pore diameter of 0.05μm and 20kDa, varying the transmembrane pressure and the concentration of the feed mixture. The comparison among the use of degummed soybean oil, refined soybean oil, crude canola oil, and refined canola oil, demonstrated that free fatty acid presented in the oils influence the formation of droplets containing glycerol. The separation was efficient when reaction mixture was produced from degummed soybean oil and crude canola oil, both with a higher acidity value. The highest free fatty acid content in the crude canola oil, not only favored the formation of a dispersed phase containing glycerol, which was retained by the membrane, but also resulted in the lowest flux decline rates. The ultrafiltration was efficient in removing glycerol, since the highest glycerol content in the permeate was 0.013wt%. This novel refining process of biodiesel showed the advantage of not requiring previous decantation to separate the two phases obtained after transesterification and the reduction in the amount of water used in the washing steps. The properties of the biodiesel produced, which were evaluated, meet the ANP biodiesel standards required for marketing. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.."

Nevertheless, freezing temperatures between -15 and -60 °C are very challenging because they frequently result in cryoinjuries. The objective of this study was to evaluate substrates associated to cryoprotective agents for Pleurotus ostreatus cryopreservation at -20 or -70 °C in order to develop alternative techniques for basidiomycete cryopreservation. P. ostreatus was grown on potato dextrose agar or whole grains of oat, wheat, rice or millet and transferred to cryovials with cryoprotective solution with 1 % dimethyl sulfoxide, 5 % glycerol, 10 % saccharose, 4 % glucose, 6 % polyethylene glycol-6000 or 5 % malt extract. The mycelium in the cryovials were cryopreserved at -20 or -70 °C and recovered for evaluation of the mycelial growth viability after 1 and 3 years. Both substrates and cryoprotectants affect the viability of the mycelial growth cryopreserved at -20 or -70 °C; wheat grains combined with cryoprotectants such as saccharose or glucose are effective for keeping mycelium viable after cryopreservation at -20 °C for 1 or 3 years; for cryopreservation at -70 °C after 1 or 3 years, any substrate combined with any cryoprotectant is effective for preserving the mycelium viable, except for millet grains with polyethylene glycol after 3 years; semi-permeable cryoprotective agents such as saccharose and glucose are the most effective for cryopreservation at -20 or -70 °C for at least 3 years. © 2012 Association of Microbiologists of India."

The reaction products were analyzed for their content of residual triglycerides, glycerol, monoglycerides, diglycerides, ethyl esters and decomposition. Results show that the configurations studied with intermediate separation of glycerol afford higher conversions of vegetable oil to their fatty acid ethyl esters derivatives when compared to the one-step reaction, with relatively low decomposition of fatty acids (< 5.0 wt%)."

Mature seeds from this hybrid were submitted to plant vitrification solution (PVS2) for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 h at 0°C. Subsequently, they were plunged into liquid nitrogen (LN) at -196°C for 1 h and recovered in half-strength Murashige and Skoog culture medium (1/2 MS), and seed germination was evaluated after 30 days. Seeds directly submitted to LN did not germinate after cryopreservation. Seeds treated with PVS2 between 1 and 3 h presented the best germination (between 51 and 58 %), although longer exposure to PVS2 returned moderated germination (39 %). Germinated seeds were further subcultured in P-723 culture medium and developed whole seedlings in vitro after 180 days, with no abnormal characteristics, diseases, or nutritional deficiencies. Seedlings were successfully acclimatized under greenhouse conditions with over 80 % survival. Flow cytometry analysis revealed no chromosomal changes on vitrified seedlings, as well as seedlings germinated from the control treatment (direct exposure to LN).

For the purpose of this study, the vegetable oil present in the HFD, i.e. soybean oil (SO) was replaced with LO (HFD-LO) or MO (HFD-MO). For comparative purposes, a group was included, which received a normal fat diet (NFD). Male Swiss mice (6-week old) were used. After 14days under the dietary conditions, the mice were fasted for 18h, and experiments were then performed. The HFD-SO, HFD-LO and HFD-MO groups showed higher glycaemia (p<0.05 versus NFD). However, no significant effect was observed on glycaemia, liver gluconeogenesis and liver ketogenesis when SO was replaced by either LO or MO. The body weight and the sum of epididymal, mesenteric, retroperitoneal and inguinal fat weights were higher (p<0.05) in the HFD-SO and HFD-MO groups as compared with the NFD group. However, there was no significant difference in these parameters between the NFD and HFD-LO groups. Thus, the protective role of LO on lipid accumulation induced by an HFD rich in saturated fatty acid is potentially mediated by the high content of ω{closed}-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid in LO. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

These procedures are not environmentally viable because they require large volumes of water and thus generate significant quantities of effluent. In this study, adsorption was employed to replace this purification step. Some commercial activated carbons were tested along with adsorbents chemically modified with HNO3. A kinetics study was conducted at 30°C and adsorption isotherms were obtained at 20°C, 30°C and 40°C. The results indicated that the adsorption of glycerol increased with the use of chemically-modified activated carbon, showing that pH has a strong influence on glycerol adsorption. The pseudo-first-order kinetic model provided the best fit with the experimental data for the monoglycerides while the pseudo-second-order model showed a better fit for the glycerol and diglycerides. The Freundlich model had the best fit with experimental data on the adsorption equilibrium for all temperatures. The thermodynamic study indicated that the adsorption process is endothermic and thus adsorption is favoured by increasing the temperature. The adsorption process using chemically-modified activated carbon was therefore very effective for the removal of waste glycerol resulting from biodiesel production, which is of considerable significance given the legal limits imposed. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis."

Thirty-two crossbred piglets, allotted in a completely randomized block design, were used in the digestibility trial. Two types of glycerin (SPGV and SPGM) and three levels of diet (4, 8 and 12%) were studied. The experimental unit consisted of one piglet. Glycerins' metabolizable energy (ME) was estimated by regression of ME (kcal kg-1) intake associated with glycerin vs. glycerin intake (kg). ME as-feed-basis rates were 3,373 for SPGV and 2,932 for SPGM, or rather, the glycerins are highly available energy source for piglets.

These films were characterized according to their microstructure, optical, mechanical, and barrier properties. The combination of starch-PVA-MMT resulted in films with a more homogeneous surface than starch films. The introduction of P VA into the starch matrix led to the formation of films with lower water vapor permeability (WVP), higher tensile strength and greater elongation. MMT was exfoliated in the films, resulting in greater stability for different relative humidities, lower WVP, higher resistance and lower flexibility."

However, during insulin-induced hypoglycemia (IIH) the release of counterregulatory hormones could overcome the insulin effect on ketogenesis. To clarify this question the ketogenic activity in livers from alloxan-diabetic rats submitted to long-term IIH was investigated. Moreover, liver glycogenolysis, gluconeogensis, ureagenesis and the production of L-lactate were measured, and its correlation with blood levels of ketone bodies (KB), L-lactate, glucose, urea and ammonia was investigated. For this purpose, overnight fasted alloxan-diabetic rats (DBT group) were compared with control non-diabetic rats (NDBT group). Long-term IIH was obtained with an intraperitoneal injection of Detemir insulin (1 U/kg), and KB, glucose, L-lactate, ammonia and urea were evaluated at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 h after insulin injection. Because IIH was well established two hours after insulin injection this time was used for liver perfusion experiments. The administration of Detemir insulin decreased (P < 0.05) blood KB and glucose levels, but there was an increase in the blood L-lactate levels and a rebound increase in blood KB during the glucose recovery phase of IIH. In agreement with these results, the capacity to produce KB from octanoate was increased in the livers of DBT rats. Moreover, the elevated blood L-lactate levels in DBT rats could be attributed to the higher (P < 0.05) glycogenolysis when part of glucose from glycogenolysis enters glycolysis, producing L-lactate. In contrast, except glycerol, gluconeogenesis was negligible in the livers of DBT rats. Therefore, during long-term IIH the higher liver ketogenic capacity of DBT rats increased the risk of hyperketonemia. In addition, in spite of the fact that the insulin injection decreased blood KB, there was a risk of worsening lactic acidosis. Copyright © 2011 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the viability of epididymal sperm after freeze-thawing. Epididymides were obtained from four adult dogs by elective orchiectomy. The caudal portion of the epididymides and part of the deferential ducts were squeezed by means of an anatomic clamp into a Petri dish containing either 0.9% saline solution (Group 1) or Ringer solution without lactate (Group 2). Samples were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was removed and the pellet was diluted in one step with a Tris/citric acid/OEP (Orvus Es Paste) extender containing 7% glycerol and subjected to semen freezing. Oocytes were obtained from canine ovaries, after ovariohysterectomy. Only oocytes that were approximately 100 μm in diameter, with a dark ooplasm surrounded by three- or four-well formed cumulus cell layers were used for sperm testing. Frozen semen samples were thawed in a water bath at 70°C for 8 s and analysed at room temperature for sperm motility and velocity. Oocytes were incubated with spermatozoa in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 at 38°C for 18 h. Morphological and functional characteristics of spermatozoa were similar in both groups. However, the percentage of sperm cells bound to oocytes was significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group 1. This result suggests that the Ringer solution without lactate was a more suitable medium for collecting epididymal canine sperm than 0.9% saline. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."

METHODS: Livers from 24-h fasted rats which received ip insulin (HII rats) or saline (control rats) were perfused in situ. The gluconeogenic substrates L-alanine (5 mmol/L), L-glutamine (5 mmol/L), L-lactate (2 mmol/L), and glycerol (2 mmol/L) were employed. The gluconeogenic activity was measured as the difference between rates of glucose released during and before the substrate infusion. In part of the experiments the production of urea was measured. Before the liver perfusion blood was collected for determination of glycemia and insulinemia. RESULTS: HII rats showed: (a) hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia; (b) increased hepatic capacity to produce glucose from L-alanine and L-glutamine; (c) increased hepatic ureogenesis from L-alanine and L-glutamine; and (d) increased hepatic glucose production from glycerol. However, hepatic glucose production from L- lactate was not affected by hypoglycemia. CONCLUSION: In spite of hyperinsulinemia the hepatic capacity to produce glucose from L-glutamine and L-alanine increased during HII. These results can be attributed to the higher hepatic catabolism of both amino acids, since the ability of the liver to produce glucose was not affected by hypoglycemia."

Glycerin inclusion in the diet reduced the time duration for feed frequency, but had no effect on the time spent for rumination frequency. However, the frequency duration for other activities increased linearly with glycerin inclusion."

Cellulose was prepared from sugarcane bagasse using a delignification and whitening approach that is wholly free of chlorine. CNW's were obtained by acid hydrolysis in hydrochloric acid. The formation of nanocomposites was demonstrated by NMR, TEM, FTIR and WAXD. The films with different concentrations of CNW and HDICNW were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, and stress-strain measurements. The samples experienced plastic deformation as subjected to an increasing elongation load, and right after yield limit, they fractured without necking. In such a case, the limit tension, which is the maximum stress supported by the sample, matches with the rupture tension. Polyurethane nanocomposites with CNW (CNW-PU) showed values of modulus of elasticity and tensile strength higher than HDICNW-PU."

In Experiment I, a digestibility assay were carried out using 32 (24 test diet and 8 basal diet) cross breed pig (45.08 ± 4.11 kg). The experimental unit consisted of one pig, with a total of four experimental units per diet. Glycerine levels used in the digestibility assay were 6, 12, and 18% of the basal diet (corn + soybean meal based). The values (as-fed-basis) of DE and ME (kcal/kg) obtained were: CGS= 5,040 and 4,481; CGA= 5,234 and 4,707, respectively. In the Experiment II, 63 pigs, were allotted in a completely randomized design in 2 x 4 factorial scheme, with two types of crude glycerine (CGS and CGA) and four inclusion levels (3, 6, 9, and 12%). Additionally, it was formulated a control diet containg no glycerine (0%). There was no interaction (P=0.05) among levels of CG and types of glycerine sources, and the regression analysis indicates no effects (P=0.05) of crude glycerine inclusion on performance and carcass traits (backfat thickness and loin depth). The results suggest that it is feasible to use up to 12% of both crude glycerine (made from soybean oil and mixed) on growing-finishing pigs diet, without impairing performance and carcass traits, besides providing a reduction of about 11% on feeding cost."

Considering that the effects of TNFα on hepatic gluconeogenesis are inconclusive, we investigated the influence of this cytokine in gluconeogenesis from various glucose precursors. TNFα (10 μg/kg) was intravenously injected in rats; 6 h later, gluconeogenesis from alanine, lactate, glutamine, glycerol, and several related metabolic parameters were evaluated in situ perfused liver. TNFα reduced the hepatic glucose production (p < 0.001), increased the pyruvate production (p < 0.01), and had no effect on the lactate and urea production from alanine. TNFα also reduced the glucose production (p < 0.01), but had no effect on the pyruvate production from lactate. In addition, TNFα did not alter the hepatic glucose production from glutamine nor from glycerol. It can be concluded that the TNFα inhibited hepatic gluconeogenesis from alanine and lactate, which enter in gluconeogenic pathway before the pyruvate carboxylase step, but not from glutamine and glycerol, which enter in this pathway after the pyruvate carboxylase step, suggesting an important role of this metabolic step in the changes mediated by TNFα. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

These materials have potential application in medical, pharmaceutical and food area. Their use depends on various parameters such as mechanical properties (strength and flexibility), barrier properties (permeability to water vapor), water solubility, among others. This work aims to characterize biofilms made from pectin and alginate. The films were prepared by casting. This technique consists in preparing a film solution (2 % w/v) followed by the application of it in a holder for solvent evaporation. The manufacturing process of the films consisted of two stages. First the alginate and pectin (1:1) were dissolved in water containing 0.04 g of CaCl2.2H2O/g macromolecule and 0.6 g glycerol/g macromolecule. The second stage (crosslinking complementary) consisted of immersing the films in 50 mL of a solution CaCl2.2H2O and glycerol, both with different concentrations, for 30 minutes. Was evaluated the effects of the plasticizer (glycerol 5, 7 and 10 % v/v) and crosslinking agent (Ca++ 3, 5 and 7 % w/v) on mechanical properties, water solubility, degree of swelling and permeability to water vapor in the biofilms. The films, with an average thickness of 0.07mm, were attractive appearance, acceptable mechanical properties, moisture content around 20 % and water solubility in the range of 32 to 55 %. These films have a degree of swelling around 1 to 3.5 %. The water vapor permeability is moderate and the values are typical of biofilms hydrophilic. Copyright © 2013, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l."

The experiments were performed in batch mode, at 55 °C and 400 rpm, and the effects of enzyme concentration (0.68-2.04 wt% related to the mass of substrates), initial water concentration (5-15 wt% related to the mass of oil), and reaction time were evaluated. A novel kinetic model is presented based on the ordered-sequential bi- bi mechanism considering hydrolysis and esterification steps, in which a correlation between water-in-oil solubility and surfactant molecules concentration in the oil allowed the model to describe the induction period in the beginning of the hydrolysis reaction. Moreover, mass transfer limitations related to the enzyme concentration in the system were also taken into account. The proposed model presented a very satisfactory agreement with the experimental data, thus allowing a better understanding of the reaction kinetics. The best conditions obtained for the product (partially hydrolyzed palm oil) in terms of DAG yield (35.91 wt%) were 2.87 wt% enzyme/substrate, 2.10 wt% water/oil, and 72 h of reaction. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012."

Therefore, the number of studies on the use of biodegradable packaging is increasing. Starch is the primary material used in the production of biodegradable plastics due to its natural abundance and high biodegradability. Yet, the strong hydrophilic character of starch presents a challenge. Therefore, the modification of its structure through oxidation may yield interesting results as the viscosity reduction. The objectives of this work were to obtain cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) starch oxidized with 0.8 and 2.0% active chlorine, to develop biodegradable films and characterize their mechanical properties, solubility in water, permeability to water vapor, degree of swelling, and sorption isotherms. Biodegradable films were produced with starch concentrations of 2, 3, 4, and 5% w/w and 25% glycerol (g/100 g starch) added as a plasticizer. Images of the films were obtained with an atomic force microscope and allow to observe a smooth surface and the absence of starch granules in the film produced with oxidized starches. The tensile strength of the biodegradable film produced with oxidized starch (0.8% active chlorine) was 80 MPa. The value of permeability to water vapor was 1.613 × 10 -9 kg/day/m/Pa, and the average solubility was 41%. The sorption isotherms showed that biodegradable films made with oxidized starches cannot be used in environments with relative humidity below 35% or above 90%. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Thus, an expected effect of sulphonylureas induced hypoglycaemia (SIH) could be the activation of LG. However, sulphonylureas infused directly in to the liver inhibits LG. Considering these opposite effects we investigated herein LG in rats submitted to SIH. For this purpose, 24h fasted rats that received glibenclamide (10mgkg -1) were used (SIH group). Control group received oral saline. Glycaemia at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150min after oral administration of glibenclamide were evaluated. Since the lowest glycaemia was obtained 120min after glibenclamide administration, this time was chosen to investigate LG in situ perfused livers. The gluconeogenesis from precursors that enters in this metabolic pathway before the mitochondrial step, i.e. L-alanine (5mM), L-lactate (2mM), pyruvate (5mM) and L-glutamine were decreased (p&lt;0·05). However, the gluconeogenic activity using glycerol (2mM), which enters in the gluconeogenesis after the mitochondrial step was maintained. Taken together, the results suggest that the inhibition of LG promoted by SIH overcome the activation of this metabolic pathway promoted by IIH and could be attributed, at least in part, to its effect on mitochondrial function. © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd."

The addition of fibres did not affect significantly the expansion index, density and WAI of materials, and reduced WSI of products, which is an advantage and promotes the use of these fibres in the reinforcement of composites.

Six formulations were prepared using a twin-screw extruder coupled with a calender. All the materials were visually homogeneous and presented good processability. Mechanical properties were dependent on both the relative humidity conditioning and the formulation; higher relative humidities detracted the mechanical properties, which was associated to plasticizer effect of the water. Furthermore, the mechanical properties were better when higher concentrations of PVA were used, resulting in films with lower opacity, lower water vapor permeability, and higher thermal stability, according to TGA.

This study indicates that ROS play a role in skeletal muscle wasting pathways in thyrotoxicosis. Two experimental groups (rats) were treated for 5 days with either 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine (HT) or HT with α-tocopherol (HT∈+∈αT). Two controls were used, vehicle (Control) and control treated with αT (Control∈+∈αT). Serum T3, peritoneal fat, serum glycerol, muscle and body weight, temperature, mitochondrial metabolism (cytochrome c oxidase activity), oxidative stress parameters and proteolytic activities were examined. High body temperature induced by HT returned to normal when animals were treated with αT, although total body and muscle weight did not. An increase in lipolysis was observed in the HT∈+∈αT group, as peritoneal fat decreased significantly together with an increase in serum glycerol. GSH, GSSG and total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP) decreased and catalase activity increased in the HT group. The glutathione redox ratio was higher in HT∈+∈αT than in both HT and Control∈+∈αT groups. Carbonyl proteins, AOPP, mitochondrial and chymotrypsin-like proteolytic activities were higher in the HT group than in the Control. HT treatment with αT restored mitochondrial metabolism, TRAP, carbonyl protein, chymotrypsin-like activity and AOPP to the level as that of the Control∈+∈αT. Calpain activity was lower in the HT∈+∈αT group than in HT and Control∈+∈αT and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was higher in the HT∈+∈αT group than in the Control∈+∈αT.

A broad view of the role of different components, added to starch-based films to improve their properties, is required to guide the future development. The self-organizing maps (SOMs) provide comparisons that initially were complicated due to the large volume of the data. Furthermore, the construction of a model capable of predicting the mechanical and barrier properties of these films will accelerate the development of films with improved characteristics. The water vapor permeability (WVP) analysis using the SOM algorithm showed that the presence of glycerol is very important for films with low amounts of poly (butylene adipate co-terephthalate) and confirms the role of the equilibrium relative humidity in the determination of WVP. Considering the mechanical properties, the SOM analysis emphasizes the important role of poly (butylene adipate co-terephthalate) in thermoplastic starch based films. The properties of biodegradable films were predicted and optimized by using a multilayer perceptron coupled with a genetic algorithm, presenting a great correlation between the experimental and theoretical values with a maximum error of 24%. To improve the response of the model and to ensure the compatibility of the components more information will be necessary. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

Biodegradable plastic bags were produced using the film with this formulation, and analysed according to the standard method of the Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas (ABNT). The bags exhibited a 45% failure rate in free-falling dart impact tests, a 10% of failure rate in dynamic load tests and no failure in static load tests. These results meet the specifications set by the standard.

This study was carried out to determine the digestible energy values of different sources of glycerol for Nile tilapia. Forty fish weighing, in average, 343.1 ± 77.7 g were distributed in four 180 liter tanks with a conned bottom, in a randomized Latin Square Design. Four experimental diets were prepared: one reference and three test diets containing 20% of the test meal and 80% of the reference diet. Chromic oxideIII was used as indicator (0.1% diet). The glycerol sources evaluated were: crude vegetable oil glycerol (GBV); semi-purified mixture glycerol (GSM); and semi-purified vegetable glycerol (GSV), in which the digestible energy values of 3058; 2610 and 1754 kcal kg-1 were obtained, respectively, without differences between the digestible energy of glycerol GBV and GSM, which were higher than GSV."

The values of glycemia (mg/dl) were 77.8 ± 7.2 (normoglycemic control), 26.2 ± 6.1 (ST IIH 0.5 h), 21.2 ± 7.6 (LT-IIH 4 h) and 35.3 ± 14.5 (LT-IIH 6.0). The LGP levels were measured in the rats submitted to ST-IIH (0.5 h) and LT-IIH (4 h or 6 h). The rats that received ip saline were used as the normoglycemic control group (COG). The livers from the COG and IIH groups (ST-IIH or LT-IIH) were perfused in situ with infusion of L-alanine (5 mM), L-glutamine (10 mM), glutamine dipeptide (5 mM), L-lactate (2 mM) or glycerol (2 mM). The ST-IIH rats showed a higher LGP level than COG group following the L-glutamine infusion (p < 0.05), but the LGP levels that were measured following the L-lactate, L-alanine, glutamine dipeptide (5 mM), L-lactate (2 mM) or glycerol infusion remained unchanged. Moreover, if the period of IIH was expanded to 4 h following insulin injection, the LGP levels induced by L-alanine, glutamine dipeptide or glycerol infusion also increased (p < 0.05, LT-IIH vs. COG). However, the LGP from the L-lactate infusion remained unchanged until 6 h after insulin injection. In conclusion, these results suggest that the intensification of liver gluconeogenesis during ST-IIH and LT-IIH in weaned rats is not a synchronous ""all or nothing"" process; instead, this process integrated in a temporal manner and is specific for each gluconeogenic substrate.

Methods: Glycemia of 24 h-fasted rats that received intraperitoneal injection (1.0 U/kg) of regular insulin (IIH group) or saline (COG group) and, 15, 150, or 165 min later, oral saline (control IIH), glycerol (100 mg/kg), pyruvate (100 mg/kg), l-lactate (100 mg/kg), or combined glycerol+pyruvate+l-lactate (each 33.3 or 100 mg/kg) was compared. In addition, for comparative purposes, a group that received glucose (100 mg/kg) was included. Glycemia was measured 180 min after insulin or saline injection. To investigate the participation of the hepatic availability of gluconeogenic substrates to GR, livers from IIH and COG rats that received physiological or supraphysiological concentrations of isolated or combined glycerol, pyruvate, and l-lactate were compared. Liver experiments were done 180 min after insulin or saline injection. Results: Oral glycerol, pyruvate, and l-lactate (isolated or combined) or glucose promoted GR. Moreover, the best GR was obtained with combined glycerol+pyruvate+l-lactate (100 mg/kg). In agreement, livers that received supraphysiological concentrations of glycerol, pyruvate, and l-lactate (isolated or combined) showed higher glucose release than livers that received physiological concentrations of these substances (isolated or combined). Conclusion: The best GR obtained with combined administration of glycerol, pyruvate, and l-lactate (100 mg/kg) during long-term IIH was a consequence of the higher liver availability of these substances associated with a maintained liver ability to produce glucose from gluconeogenic substrates. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

They were fed with four treatments, with 8 repetitions. Animals were slaughtered when they reached approximately 35 kilos. The mean total weight gain was 20.72 kilos and mean daily weight gain was 260 grams. No changes resulted from glycerin use. The carcass performance was similar among treatments (P&gt;0.05) and the cold carcass performance (CCP) was 44.68%. There were no effects (P&gt;0.05) on the loin eye area (LEA) and on fat thickness (FT); they showed averages of 13.66 cm2 and 0.84 mm, respectively.

The smallest nutrition amount consisted of 21% crude glycerin. The gross profit ranged from R$30.75 to R$ 34.01 per animal, for feed without glycerin and 21% glycerin, respectively. Animal development was not impacted by glycerin introduction, even with decrease on dry and organic mass consumption. The result showed that crude glycerin inclusion might be used in lambs' diet. Whenever there are big amounts of feed involved in the process, the 21% crude glycerin addition may be an interesting cost reduction.

Considering little knowledge about crude glycerol utilization in feeds for Neotropical fish species, it was evaluated the apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) for energy of crude glycerol for P. mesopotamicus and R. quelen. The digestibility and digestible energy content of crude glycerol can be considered excellent even when compared to energy of common ingredients such as maize and wheat, presenting 0.97 and 0.89 of energy ADCs, and 15.2 and 13.95MJ kg-1 of digestible energy for Pacu and Silver catfish, respectively.

IIH was obtained with increasing doses (from 0.5 to 2.0 U·kg-1) of intraperitoneal regular insulin where glycemia was evaluated from 0 to 300 min after insulin injection. The dose of 1.0 U·kg-1 showed the best results, that is, a clear glycemia recovery phase without convulsions or deaths. Thus, this dose was used in all experiments. Afterwards, mice submitted to IIH received orally by gavage: saline (control group), glucose (100 mg·kg-1), glycerol (100 mg·kg-1), lactate (100 mg·kg-1), alanine (100 mg·kg-1), or glutamine (100 mg·kg-1).

The addition of glycerol analytical grade (AG) and glycerol crude (CG) to soybean and castorbean meals separately and in combination, were also examined for lipase production. Glycerol-AG increased enzyme production, whereas glycerol-CG decreased it. A 24 factorial design was developed to determine the best concentrations of soybean meal, castorbean meal, glycerol-AG, and KH2PO4 to optimize lipase production by B. ribis EC-01. Soybean meal and glycerol-AG had a significant effect on lipase production, whereas castorbean meal did not. A second treatment (22 factorial design central composite) was developed, and optimal lipase production (4,820 U/g of dry solids content (ds)) was obtained when B. ribis EC-01 was grown on 0.5 % (w/v) soybean meal and 5.2 % (v/v) glycerol in distilled water, which was in agreement with the predicted value (4,892 U/g ds) calculated by the model. The unitary cost of lipase production determined under the optimized conditions developed ranged from US$0.42 to 0.44 based on nutrient costs. The fungal lipase was immobilized onto Celite and showed high thermal stability and was used for transesterification of soybean oil in methanol (1:3) resulting in 36 % of fatty acyl alkyl ester content.

Since mitotic recombination plays a crucial role in multistep carcinogenesis, the study of the recombinagenic potential of chemical compounds is of the utmost importance. In our research genotoxicity of cremophor EL has been studied by using an uvsH//uvsH diploid strain of Aspergillus nidulans. Since it spends a great part of its cell cycle in the G2 period, this fungus is a special screening system for the study of mitotic recombination induced by chemical substances. Homozygotization Indexes (HI) for paba and bi markers from heterozygous B211//A837 diploid strain were determined for the evaluation of the recombinagenic effect of cremophor EL. It has been shown that cremophor EL induces increase in mitotic crossing-over events at nontoxic concentrations (0.05 and 0.075% v/v)."

Poplar woodchips pretreated hydrothermally in an experimental industrial pilot-plant generated two prehydrolyzate streams; purge-condensate collected from cooking the woodchips and press-filtrate collected after the fiber explosion step. Both prehydrolyzates contain hemicellulose sugars (pentoses, hexoses, oligosaccharides), acetic acid, and degradation products from hemicellulose and lignin (furanic and phenolic compounds, respectively). Purge prehydrolyzate was highly diluted, of low sugar content and high biochemical/chemical oxygen demand, and constituted a process waste that was addressed for value-adding through production of enzymes by fermentation. Wood-decay fungi were screened for laccases on purge prehydrolyzate, with Botryosphaeria rhodina producing highest titers. B. rhodina detoxified the prehydrolyzate but at expense of sugar consumption. Adding xylose and glycerol to purge did not inhibit fungal growth or impede laccase production. Phenolics in the purge had inducing effect on enhancing laccase titers. Laccase production was optimized by Box-Behnken-(33)-factorial design varying the concentration of xylose in the purge, together with adding copper as laccase inducer and glycerol to increase the level of fermentable substrate, resulting in optimal enzyme titers (36.37 ± 3.52U/mL; validated). The crude laccase preparation was employed to detoxify the more concentrated press prehydrolyzate, reducing the overall content of phenolics by ∼30 %.

Thermoplastic starch and polyester blends are an interesting alternative to current materials due to the low cost of starch and the functional properties and processability of the resulting blends. Producing thermoplastic starch (TPS) requires using a plasticiser at concentrations between 20 and 30%wt (in relation to starch). Glycerol is the most common plasticiser due to its high plasticising capacity and thermal stability at processing temperatures. The objective of this study was to evaluate glycerol waste from the biodiesel industry, with different degrees of purification, as plasticisers for TPS/poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) blends. Different purities of glycerol produced films with similar mechanical, optical and barrier properties to those made with purified glycerol (99.7%). Therefore, crude glycerol is a renewable alternative plasticiser that reduces the cost of plasticisation by 6-fold."

Loss of quality in this fruit is mostly due to its relatively high metabolic activity and sensitivity to fungal decay, meanly grey mold (Botrytis cinerea). In this study, the ability of gelatin coatings containing cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) to extend the shelf-life of strawberry fruit (Fragaria ananassa) over 8 days were studied. The filmogenic solution was obtained by the hydration of 5 g of gelatin (GEL) in 100 mL of distillated water containing different amounts of CNC dispersion (10 mg CNC/g of GEL or 50 mg of CNC/g of GEL) for 1 hour at room temperature. After this period, the solution was heated to 70°C and maintained at this temperature for 10 minutes. The plasticizer (glycerol) (10g/100g of the GEL) was then added with constant, gentle stirring in order to avoid forming air bubbles and also to avoid gelatin denaturation until complete homogenization. Strawberries (purchased at the local market) were immersed in the filmogenic solution for 1 minute and after coated were dried at 15°C by 24 hours. The strawberries were then kept under refrigeration and characterized in terms of their properties (weight loss, ascorbic acid content, titratable acidity, water content). The results have shown that samples covered with GEL/CNC had a significant improvement in its shelf- life. For instance, for the control sample (without coating) the weight loss after 8 days of storage was around 65%, while covered samples loss in the range of 31-36%. Edible coating was also effective in the retention of ascorbic acid (AA) in the strawberries, while control sample presented a fast decay in the AA content, covered samples showed a slow decay in the AA concentration. Moreover, the use of GEL/CNC edible coating had an antimicrobial effect in the fruits."

Formulations containing 95:5 or 90:10 FS: β-CD ratio and about 5% of glyceryl monostearate (GMS) as a glidant provided homogeneous, continuous, and flexible films. Water vapour transmission (WVT) increased with an increase in β-CD concentration. On the other hand, how major was the β-CD amount lower was found the Is% for the film. Physicochemical analysis using TG revealed an initial thermal decomposition temperature shift that indicated lower thermal stability for films with 90:10 or 95:5 FS: β-CD ratio compared with the control (100:0). The results of FT-IR did not give evidence of any intermolecular interaction between β-CD and the acrylic polymer, showing just a physical mixture of both components in formulation."

The most divergent species were G. sylvius and G. pantanal (D = 0.117), and the most similar were G. inaequilabiatus and G. pantanal (D = 0.051). The data indicates that the observed genetic variability was very low and the expected variability estimated for these three species is very high, and the genetic differences among them are small.

This study aimed to evaluate the maintenance and preservation of B. firmus strain 37 stored in a solid medium, sterile soil and in glycerol at low temperature (-70°C). In order to evaluate the best bacteria maintenance method, cell immobilization procedures were used on inorganic matrices. The immobilized cells were submitted to the initial biomass effect test and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Periodic transfer was not an appropriate method, because the strain reduced the production of CGTase. The storage in sterile soil proved effective and the enzyme production remained constant. The conservation in low temperatures was also satisfactory, with cell counts practically the same after 360 days. The immobilization evaluated by SEM did not show any difference in the adsorption of the cells preserved by the different methods. The same happened for the initial biomass effect test, which presented higher beta-CD production when 1.5 g of cells was used."

Films plasticized with GLY presented a more significant reduction in the elongation at break (EB). In contrast, films plasticized with SOR did not show a significant difference in the EB. The film's water vapor permeability (WVP) and acid solubility increased with increasing proportions of GEL while the water solubility was decreased. On the other hand, the elongation at break of the films decreased with increasing GEL content, which may be associated with its more rigid structure.

PVA/starch sheets were produced by extrusion-calendering using five PVA grades with different molecular weights (MW) and hydrolysis degrees (HD). The blends were composed by 40:25:35 wt% of native cassava starch, PVA and glycerol as plasticizer respectively, and sheets were produced in a twin-screw extruder coupled in a 3-roll water-cooled calender. The sheets were characterized by mechanical properties, water vapor permeability, opacity, X-ray diffraction, crystallinity index, FT-IR spectra, and microstructure (SEM). The biodegradable sheets presented satisfactory processability, handleability, and mechanical properties, with a uniform appearance. The materials produced with high HD PVA were more rigid, and those produced with high MW PVA were more resistance, and all PVA grades had good compatibility with starch in the extrusion-calendering process. Therefore the PVA/starch blends are adequate for industrial scale production of biodegradable materials.

However, its production usually leads to the formation of large amounts of glycerol as a byproduct. This article reports the evaluation of catalytic glycerol etherification with ethanol over a series of catalysts in a continuous reactor. Amberlyst 15 presented the best performance in terms of glycerol conversion and yield of ethers. This result was attributed to its high pore size and acidity. Beta zeolite (Si/Al = 12.5) and niobic acid, both with lower acid strengths and pore sizes, were almost inactive in the conversion of glycerol into ethers. A central composite design was developed to optimize the performance of Amberlyst 15. An increase in catalyst amount enhanced both the glycerol conversion and the yield of ethers. However, high temperatures and low molar ratios favored side reactions. The optimized value for glycerol conversion was 91%, and that for the yield of ethers was 13%, under different reaction conditions. © 2017 American Chemical Society."

FTIR, DSC, TGA, SEM, EDS, XRD and DMA analyses show significant changes in morphology, chemistry, enthalpy, crystallinity and glass transition temperature confirming that PEDOT:PSS and glycerol are not only spread over the PA66 yarn surfaces but are dispersed in the bulk facilitating relaxation and increasing structure and chain flexibility. Electrochemical and electrical resistivity (ρ) measurements confirm that the plasma treated PA66 coated with 5 layers of PEDOT:PSS + GLY presents the highest stability, resistance and capacitive behaviour, and the best capability of storing electrical energy. This configuration needs only 7.5 V to induce a temperature change up to 38 °C at a current density of 0.3 A g−1. The desired temperature is easily adjustable as a function of the applied voltage and by the number of coated layers of PEDOT:PSS + GLY. Despite the need to improve the uniformity of the coating thickness on the fabric for uniform heat generation, the observed results are quite impressive since they can be compared to the temperature obtained in carbon nanotube composites using similar voltages.

The must presented 164 g/L of glucose (15 ºBx) and pH of 2.67 was fermented for 22 h at 25C by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Fermented alcoholic (rice wine) reached yield value of 74.94% (Y1), 91.71% (Y2) and productivity (Pp) of 2.85 g/Lh in alcohol, with alcohol concentration of 62.8 g/L, 28.0 g/L of glucose, 2.5 °Bx and pH of 3.0. The kinetic parameters – Yp/s 27.75%, μN 0.008 h−1, gt 3.99 h, PN 0.13 logUFC/mLh – were determined. The wine contained a total of 11 volatile compounds identified by GC-FID, 7 alcohols (methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, iso-amylic alcohols, iso-butanol and glycerol), 2 aldehydes (acetaldehyde and acetol), 1 ester (ethyl acetate) and 1 ketone (acetone). Practical Applications: The product obtained showed potential features to be employed not only as alcoholic beverage, but also as a raw material in the production of other products such as vinegar, adding value to rice processing. Considering the production outlook and the amount of generated by-product, it is a lower cost substrate for such application. The characterization of volatile flavor compounds might be made use not only for a better understanding of this new-type product, but also for the further utilization in other wine or alcohol production. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Visible and near-infrared (VIS-NIR) spectroscopy is a reliable analytical tool for objective analyses of biological sample attributes. The objective is to investigate the potential of VIS-NIR spectroscopy as a process analytical technology for compositional characterization of biodegradable materials and correlation to their mechanical properties. Biofilms were produced by single-screw extrusion with different combinations of polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate, whole oat flour, glycerol, magnesium stearate, and citric acid. Spectral data were recorded in the range of 400-2498 nm at 2 nm intervals. Partial least square regression was used to investigate the correlation between spectral information and mechanical properties. Results show that spectral information is influenced by the major constituent components, as they are clustered according to polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate content. Results for regression models using the spectral information as predictor of tensile properties achieved satisfactory results, with coefficients of prediction (R2<inf>C</inf>) of 0.83, 0.88 and 0.92 (calibration models) for elongation, tensile strength, and Young's modulus, respectively. Results corroborate the correlation of NIR spectra with tensile properties, showing that NIR spectroscopy has potential as a rapid analytical technology for non-destructive assessment of the mechanical properties of the films. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Models based on COSMO (COnductor-like Screening MOdels) are viable alternatives to group-contribution methods. These methods may be used to determine the activity coefficient of the components in any mixtures. In this paper, the model COSMO-SAC, developed by Lin and Sandler (2002), was used to predict the activity coefficients for binary mixtures (methanol + glycerol), (methanol + water) and (glycerol + water). Prior to these calculations, the software Gaussian 03 was used to perform the structure optimization of molecules of water, methanol and glycerol, in order to find which molecule conformation has lower energy. Then, sigma profiles of the components were obtained using the software MOPAC. Data of experimental activity coefficients (γexp) obtained from literature (Soujanya et al., 2010) were compared with calculated values (γcalc) by two different methods. In the first method, the sigma profiles obtained from software MOPAC were used to calculate the activity coefficients. In the second one, they were obtained from the software known as JCOSMO, which uses the sigma profiles from VT-2005 database. The mean absolute deviation between γ exp e γ calc by the two methods analyzed were calculated. The results show that the method based on COSMO not adequately predicted the activity coefficients of the mixtures analyzed for both methods of obtaining the sigma profile. Despite the sigma profiles generated by the software MOPAC are different from those obtained by VT-2005 database, the values of the activity coefficients obtained by both methods showed no major deviations. Furthermore, COSMO-SAC model was used to calculate phase equilibrium by minimizing the Gibbs energy of the binary mixtures. These calculations were performed Copyright © 2015, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l."

Thus, the samples, which were diluted in 10 ml of extender without glycerol (Botubov® I, Botupharma, Botucatu, SP, Brazil), were evaluated on motility, sperm vigor, structural and functional (swelling hypoosmotic test) membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity, sperm viability and ADN fragmentation. The samples were divided into two aliquots and diluted in extender with glycerol (Botubov® II, Botupharma, Botucatu, SP, Brazil) at a concentration of 50x106 motile sperm/0.5 French straws. One sample was frozen by the conventional method (4 hours at 5°C, in a refrigerator and 20 min in nitrogen vapor) and the other by the automated method (Cryogen® Dualflex, Neovet, Uberaba, MG, Brazil). The parameters were higher in all the tests of fresh sperm samples, with the exception of the swelling hypoosmotic test, which showed no significant difference when the results were compared with sperm frozen by the conventional method. The average motility of fresh spermatozoa was 74%, and conventional and automated averages were 29 and 25%, respectively.

Knowledge of these mechanisms could contribute to new strategies for treating diabetes. Objective: This study evaluated the effects of caffeine and physical exercise on glycemic and insulin responses in diabetic rats. Materials and methods: The diabetes model was induced by intraperitoneal administration of 60mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ). Animals were divided into six groups: control, caffeine, STZ control, STZ caffeine, STZ sulfonylurea, and STZ caffeine+sulfonylurea. Acutely, control animals received 6mg of caffeine and 10mg/kg sulfonylurea or 10mg/kg saline. Animals were sacrificed after physical exercise; blood samples were collected for glucose, glycerol, lactate, and insulin analyses. Cardiovascular responses were recorded before and after treatments. A one-way ANOVA and the post hoc Student-Newman-Keuls test were used to analyze statistical differences between treatments (p<0.05). Results: About 6mg/kg of caffeine did not alter cardiovascular responses, but promoted blood glucose reduction after 60min of exercise when compared to animals in the control groups (387-187mg/dL; p<0.05). Insulin levels increased significantly (0.6-10μU/mL; p<0.05) in rats that received acute caffeine treatment associated with sulfonylurea compared to rats in the other groups. Discussion and conclusion: Acute caffeine intake with exercise can increase glucose uptake enhancing insulin secretion stimulated by sulfonylurea in β cells-deficient pancreas. The results indicate the potential use of caffeine as a strategy for glycemic and insulin control in diabetes. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc."

But in the process of cryopreservation, some studies show a decrease in the quality of the sperm when left under cooling before frozen for some time. This study aimed to assess the quality of the epididymal sperm obtained from domestic cats after cryopreservation using a diluent based on egg yolk and glycerol (Botu-crio®), comparing the morphofunctional characteristics after cooling for 24 hours in a container of semen transport (Botu-tainer®). We use eight cats submitted to elective orchiectomy, aging from eight months, without racial determination, and good nutritional status. These sperm characteristics were: motility, vigor, concentration, membrane integrity and morphology. It has been found, after statistical analysis, that the container of semen was able to maintain sperm viability, even for 24h. We also observed a significant decrease on all parameters after frozen, consequential, probably to thermal stress that occurs in processing. However, the percentage of membrane integrity after thawing shows good employability of the Botu-crio®, which viability is possible to perform in vitro fertilization, requiring higher ratings."

An example for the last case is biodiesel production, which yields glycerol. The enzyme Lipolase (Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase) produced by submerged fermentation of genetically modified Aspergillus oryzae was studied. The transesterification activity test indicated that the highest activity was achieved at 40°C with moisture content of 30% in the biocatalyst. Both temperature and moisture content significantly influenced the process. The design variables analyzed independently, as well as their interaction, were significant in a confidence interval of 95%, indicating that the proposed model is valid. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the CHISA 2012 - 20th International Congress of Chemical and Process Engineering and PRES 2012 - 15th Conference PRES (Prague, Czech Republic 8/25-29/2012)."

In the present study, three blastocysts were frozen using the slow protocol with glycerol as cryoprotector. Before freezing, the embryos were passed through a 5% glycerol solution followed by 9% glycerol plus 0.2 M saccharose. The embryos were rapidly thawed and transferred to a 5% glycerol plus 0.1 M saccharose solution, and then passed through a solution containing only 0.1 M saccharose. After 2 h of incubation in culture medium the embryos were transferred to the patient. Pregnancy was confirmed by the presence of a heart beat 6 weeks after transfer. Therefore, embryo freezing at the blastocyst stage is not an obstacle to prolonged culture."
